// Shared types for the MCAP recorder (docs/history/refactor/recorder-container.md
// §2 decision + §3): the orchestrator-side writer facade, the channel→writer
// topology seam, and the main↔worker message protocol. Vue-free and
// core-free — `writer.ts`/the worker never touch `core`; all Mat/PixelFormat
// handling stays in `index.ts` (the sink layer), so the worker host code
// stays a pure bytes-in/bytes-out pipeline like `stream-writer.ts`'s worker.
