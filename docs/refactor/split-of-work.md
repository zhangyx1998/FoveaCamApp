# Split of Work — dispatch & log interface

> **This file is the only planner↔coder interface.** All other
> `docs/refactor/*.md` files are the planner's own tracking — coders do
> not edit them (this supersedes any older instruction to "log under
> Stage 4 in orchestrator.md"). Design specs still live there; active
> instructions below link to them read-only.

## Planner

The planner (Claude session directed by Yuxuan) owns everything about
this effort except writing the implementation itself. **Incoming
planners: read [`planner.md`](./planner.md) first — the full handover
(state, dispatch mechanics, environment gotchas, next actions).**

- **Sequencing & scope.** Decides what work exists, splits it into
  stages/rounds/instructions, orders it against dependencies and
  hardware availability, and keeps each coder's active set small and
  collision-free (the file-ownership table below is the planner's to
  maintain).
- **Specs.** Writes the design record in the planner docs
  (`orchestrator.md`, `synced-capture.md`, `verification-playbook.md`,
  …) and distills it into dispatch-ready instructions here — scope,
  spec pointer, DoD — so coders never have to infer intent.
- **Verification.** Each iteration: checks every coder log **against
  the actual code**, re-runs the standing gates independently (never
  trusts a reported gate), and files defects as findings with severity,
  a concrete failure scenario, and a fix spec. Claimed-but-absent work
  is a finding, not a misunderstanding.
- **Steering & release.** Writes `Steering:` notes under instructions
  that need fixes; releases the next stage/phase only after the current
  one's issues are resolved. Accepted instruction+log pairs are
  archived into the planner docs, then deleted from this file.
- **Escalation to the user.** The planner does not commit (the user
  commits at planner-declared checkpoints), does not run the hardware
  rig, and surfaces contract-level tradeoffs (e.g. preview quality vs.
  transport cost) as explicit user decisions rather than deciding them.

## Protocol

- The planner writes numbered instructions under each role's **Active
  instructions**, each with scope, spec pointer, DoD, and an empty
  **Log:** slot.
- Coders implement **only their active instructions**, then append a
  compact log (≤ 15 lines) under that instruction's **Log:** — what
  landed, gates run with results, deviations from spec, and one-line
  notes for any out-of-scope discovery (do not fix those inline).
- Each iteration the planner verifies logs against code, writes
  **Steering:** notes under the instruction where fixes are needed, and
  releases the next instructions once the current ones are accepted.
  Accepted instruction+log pairs are **deleted** (planner archives what
  matters into the planner docs first) — this file stays short.
- Do not edit: other roles' sections, the protocol/ownership sections,
  or any other `docs/refactor/*` file. When your items are done, stop.

**Dispatch mechanics — DUAL FLEET (gpt-5.5 active for implementation +
Opus 4.8 warm reserve; 2026-07-07, per user).** Two worker fleets are
kept warm so the planner can switch a role between them wave-to-wave:
- **gpt-5.5 (Codex) — OUT OF USAGE as of 2026-07-07 (per user); Opus 4.8 is
  now the SOLE active fleet, all three roles.** When quota returns it resumes
  as an available fleet. Dispatched via
  `scripts/dispatch-worker.sh <A|B|C> ["note"]` in a background Bash
  (the planner is re-invoked on exit); first run per role warms up from
  a fresh session (kickoff onboards from AGENTS.md + this file), later
  runs `codex exec resume` the same session id (`.worker-logs/
  session-<role>.id`) with a steering-first re-entry. gpt-5.5 at high
  reasoning effort, model + effort pinned in the script. Sandbox:
  workspace-write, no network.
- **Claude Opus 4.8 subagents — the WARM RESERVE.** One persistent
  in-harness Agent per role (`subagent_type: "claude"`, `model:
  "opus"`), resumed via `SendMessage` (context intact — a fresh `Agent`
  call starts cold). Parked/resumable between waves; the planner can
  hand a role's next wave to Opus instead of gpt-5.5 when it wants the
  switch. Parked agent ids: A `ac10aaf887cee3837`, B `a12135ab7a5a9139e`,
  C `a902c02a702cffe03`.
Both fleets share the planner's filesystem/environment; the docs (this
file + planner docs) are the complete memory, so either fleet is
re-warmable from current docs and a role can move between them without
context loss. Each worker is **warmed up before its first task** (an
onboarding read-through + takeover note the planner checks) then fed its
active instructions. At most one active worker per role at a time; roles
run concurrently (ownership table keeps domains disjoint). Sandbox:
workers write only within the repo; no network / `npm install` without a
planner-logged grant in the instruction.

## File ownership

Exactly one owner per path; touching a file you don't own requires a
planner-logged handoff (ask via your log, don't just edit).

**OPTIMIZATION SURVEY — shared instruction text for A-14/B-7/C-9 (user
directive 2026-07-07):** survey YOUR OWNED SURFACE (ownership table)
for: (1) **repetitive logic patterns** — near-duplicate code that wants
a shared helper or abstraction; (2) **long, wordy variable/function
names** — propose concise alternatives that fit this project's voice
(sample the best existing names as the target register; a rename map is
a fine proposal format); (3) **better-fit solutions** — places where a
different structure/API/algorithm would serve the project's actual use
case better, INCLUDING large breaking changes if they steer the
codebase to a better overall state. Write proposals to
`docs/refactor/proposals/<ROLE>.md` (yours for this round), ranked by
value, max ~15, each with: id (`<ROLE>-P<n>`), location(s),
current → proposed (sketch, not implementation), **category:
non-breaking | breaking**, rationale tied to a real cost (duplication
count, call-site count, past bugs in that area), effort (S/M/L), risk.
NO CODE CHANGES in this phase. Triage rule (planner-executed):
non-breaking gets green-lit directly; breaking goes to the user.
Log a 3-line pointer under your Log: slot when done.

## Coder A — App & sessions (renderer, orchestrator JS, Electron shell)

Owns all non-SHM application code: feature modules
(`contract/session/index.vue`), orchestrator runtime/sessions/store-hub,
shared app libs, Electron main/preload (non-SHM), Vue surfaces, app
tests. Boundary rules to preserve: hardware/vision/control stays
orchestrator-side; renderer stays a thin session client, zero-core;
orchestrator-reachable code stays Vue-free; never mark
hardware-dependent behavior verified without a real rig run.

### Active instructions

- **A-23 — keep-busy loop toward the milestone (user 2026-07-07; posture: break
  freely within your surface, converge by the milestone).** Iterative survey-and-
  implement on YOUR surface, HIGH VALUE not churn. Priority order:
  1. **A-P1 — resource-scoped session lifecycle (the breaking refactor, now
     GREEN-LIT).** It's A-owned and on the convergence path (WS2 foundation); take
     it on directly rather than only prepping around it. Build on your A-R2-P1
     `DisposerBag`/lease substrate. Break internal session APIs as needed; keep it
     converging (your own gates green by end of the batch, or flag convergent WIP).
  2. **Test coverage on the newly-landed refactor substrate** (de-risks the rig
     pass): A-20/A-21 window-ownership/cascade (owner/childrenOf/onOwnerClose/keyed
     toggle/debug cascade/planFromManifest drop) + the A-22 frame↔voltage write
     path (`recording.ts` fin-averaged vs live-snapshot, `deps.foveaBinding`).
  3. **Dedup / naming / structure** on A-owned files — opportunistic.
  - **RULES (loosened).** You MAY break things WITHIN your own surface
    (restructure, break internal APIs, behavior-change your own modules) when it's
    higher-value and converges by the milestone. **PROPOSE-first only for breaks
    that cross a boundary others depend on:** the pinned `viewer-contract.ts`, wire
    contracts consumed by other roles, on-disk/persisted-key formats — those I
    sequence (convergence management, not fear). **COLLISION EXCLUSIONS still
    hold** (reserved for in-flight cross-role work): do NOT touch
    `app/orchestrator/registry.ts` or any camera→SHM write path (C's real-1c seam),
    `app/orchestrator/metering.ts` / `app/src/profiler/**` (C-18), or C-owned
    files. A C-18 handoff for a `system.ts`/`contracts.ts` workloads-type field you
    MAY do.
  - **Cadence.** Implement a small batch → run gates → append a dated sub-log
    entry under A-23 → continue with the next batch. Keep going until I post a
    Steering: note ending the loop (the milestone). If you run out of clearly-
    non-breaking high-value work, STOP and say so — do NOT invent churn.
  - **DoD each batch.** vue-tsc 0; `vitest run` green; `vite build`; renderer
    zero-core; orchestrator zero-Vue; V11 if a preload is touched. No hardware
    claim. Note any surface needing user visual check.
  - Log:
    - **2026-07-07 batch 1 (test coverage — A-21 substrate gaps).** Filled two
      untested paths: (a) `planFromManifest` drop-on-restore for owner-bound
      cascade windows — NEW window-manifest tests (debug dropped beside an app;
      debug-only manifest → just welcome). (b) window-manager: one debug window
      per session all cascading with the owner app (distinct keys → 2 children →
      both destroyed on app close); toggleDebug with no app window spawns an
      ownerless non-cascading debug window (defensive). Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest
      248/248 (+5); (test-only — no bundle change). No behavior change.
    - **2026-07-07 batch 2 (A-22 write-path coverage).** Extracted the fovea
      voltage-binding selection out of the `createRecording` closure into an
      exported pure `resolveFoveaBinding(deps, conv, mirror)` (internal refactor,
      identical behavior) so the fin/live branch is unit-testable. NEW tests (3):
      binds the FIN outcome when `deps.foveaBinding` matches (source "fin",
      frame_id), falls back to live snapshot when it returns null AND when the
      hook is absent. Gates: vue-tsc 0; vite build OK; renderer zero-core 0;
      orch zero-Vue 0; recording-metadata 5/5 (isolated). **Note:** full vitest
      shows 3 failures in `test/workload-view.test.ts` — those are C-18's
      concurrent metering/profiler work on the shared tree (C-owned, excluded
      from my scope), NOT this batch; all 253 non-workload-view tests pass.
    - **2026-07-07 batch 3 (A-P1 building-block coverage).** `session-resources.ts`
      (DisposerBag/releaseLeases/bindViews — the primitives the future breaking
      A-P1 sits on) had NO direct tests. NEW `test/session-resources.test.ts`
      (8): DisposerBag order/idempotent-dispose/push; releaseLeases null-safe +
      LeaseSet + CalibratedTriple.leases; bindViews default-frame-publish +
      custom onView + unsubscribers-added-to-bag. Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest
      268/268 (+8; C-18's workload-view failures from batch 2 are resolved —
      C committed). test-only. (Priority-2 lease adoption surveyed: the 7 triple
      sessions are all already on the primitives; the remaining single-lease/Map
      sessions — calibrate-intrinsic/manage-cameras/single-capture — don't fit
      the triple primitives, so no further adoption without inventing a one-off
      = churn, skipped.)
    - **2026-07-07 batch 4 (A-P1 core machinery — GREEN-LIT).** NEW
      `app/orchestrator/resource-session.ts`: `defineResourceSession(name,
      contract, build)` + `ResourceScope` (`defer`/`add`/`push`/`use`/
      `cancelled`), built ON the A-R2-P1 session-resources primitives. Each
      activation gets a generation-tagged scope that OWNS its cleanups and
      drains them LIFO on idle; enforces the two lifecycle invariants the
      hand-rolled sessions kept re-breaking: (1) ordered async drain — `idle()`
      returns a promise `drained()` awaits (V1/RT1); (2) stale-async-completion
      safety — a slow `activate` superseded by idle/re-activate releases every
      resource it acquires instead of leaking, and a re-activation serializes
      behind the prior drain (V5/V10). Additive: sits ALONGSIDE `defineSession`,
      no session migrated yet (incremental next). NEW `test/resource-session.test.ts`
      (7): LIFO drain, use auto-release, superseded-slow-activate no-leak,
      re-activation-waits-for-drain, idle-hook-after-drain, throwing-activate
      caught, defer-after-supersession-runs-now. Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest
      275/275 (+7); vite build OK; orch zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0.
    - **2026-07-07 batch 5 (A-P1 reference migration — calibrate-drift).**
      Migrated `modules/calibrate-drift/session.ts` from `defineSession` to
      `defineResourceSession`: `activate(scope,s)` registers each resource's
      cleanup on the scope (lease via `scope.use` → releases LAST; trackers/
      taps(DisposerBag)/servo/timer via `scope.defer`), `idle()` is just the
      `resetTelemetry` hook (scope drains automatically, LIFO). Teardown order
      preserved (servo→trackers→taps→leases-last); adds cancel-safety
      (superseded slow activate releases leases) + a real awaitable drain for
      the multi-window switch path. Behavior-preserving; **HARDWARE-FACING —
      code-verified only, needs a rig pass** (the machinery is unit-tested in
      batch 4; calibration sessions have no unit harness). Gates: vue-tsc 0;
      vitest 275/275; vite build OK; orch zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0.
      Next: migrate the remaining triple sessions (distortion/multi-fovea/
      extrinsic/tracking/manual-control) one per batch. **Pending handoff
      (C-18, will slot in):** extend `stats.ts`/`contracts.ts` workload
      stream-counter `CounterRate` → `WorkloadStreamStat = CounterRate &
      {maxIntervalMs}` (mirror C's metering.ts type; additive).
    - **2026-07-07 batch 6 (C-18 handoff — workload stream-stat type).** Added
      `WorkloadStreamStat = CounterRate & { maxIntervalMs?: number }` to
      `stats.ts` and used it for `WorkloadSnapshot.inputs/outputs`; extended
      `contracts.ts` `WorkloadCounterSnapshot` with `maxIntervalMs?`. Profiler
      now reads `maxIntervalMs` TYPED (no `as any` cast). **Deviation from the
      handoff (flagged):** made it OPTIONAL not required — C's own
      `workload-view.test.ts` fixtures (C-owned, collision-excluded) omit
      `maxIntervalMs`, so a REQUIRED field would fail vue-tsc on a file I can't
      touch. Optional is non-breaking + still typed; C can tighten to required
      alongside updating those fixtures. metering.ts already sets it at runtime.
      Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 275/275; vite build OK; zero-Vue/zero-core.
    - **2026-07-07 batch 7 (A-P1 migration — calibrate-distortion).** Same
      pattern as drift: `defineResourceSession`, leases via `scope.use`
      (release-last), trackers/taps/actuation-loop via `scope.defer` (LIFO
      drain), idle hook resets centerAngle/projection + telemetry. Teardown
      order preserved; cancel-safe + awaitable drain. Behavior-preserving,
      **hardware-facing — code-verified only.** Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest
      275/275; vite build OK; zero-Vue/zero-core. Triple sessions migrated:
      drift, distortion (2/6). Remaining: multi-fovea, calibrate-extrinsic,
      tracking-single, manual-control — next batches, one per.
    - **2026-07-07 batch 8 (A-P1 migration — multi-fovea).** `scheduler`/
      `runtime` stay session-level singletons; per activation the lease (via
      `scope.use`, release-last) + the C.onView tap are scoped, and the drain
      stops the scheduler + disposes the runtime (re-populated by `applyTargets`
      on the next activate, as before). Tap registered LAST → drains FIRST so no
      center frame reaches a disposed runtime mid-teardown (tightens a latent
      order the hand-rolled idle had). Behavior-preserving; **hardware-facing —
      code-verified only.** Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 277/277; vite build OK;
      zero-Vue/zero-core. Triple sessions: drift, distortion, multi-fovea (3/6).
    - **2026-07-07 batch 9 (A-P1 migration — calibrate-extrinsic, the wizard).**
      Two-stage acquire (matchTriple → center-intrinsic load) still releases
      IMMEDIATELY on either failure (+ `scope.cancelled` guards); the lease
      becomes scope-owned (deferred, release-last) only once both succeed.
      servo/preview toggle per wizard step via `enterStep` (imperative,
      unchanged); the scope's drain (registered LAST → drains FIRST) stops
      whichever is active. taps→local DisposerBag; idle hook resets fitted
      regressions + telemetry. Behavior-preserving; **hardware-facing —
      code-verified only.** Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 277/277; vite build OK;
      zero-Vue/zero-core. Triple sessions: +calibrate-extrinsic (4/6).
    - **2026-07-07 batch 10 (A-P1 migration — tracking-single, minimal/surgical
      per the KCF cut-over heads-up).** Thin swap of activate/idle: tracker/
      kinematic/frame-workers stay session-level singletons; per activation the
      lease (`scope.use`, release-last) + 3 stream taps (local DisposerBag) +
      actuation loop are scoped. Drain LIFO: loop.stop → disengage(false) →
      taps → worker-cancels → triple/size/lastFrameTime reset → leases. Did NOT
      restructure the tracker/worker plumbing (leaving it clean for the
      KcfTrackerStream swap). Behavior-preserving; **hardware-facing —
      code-verified only.** Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 277/277; vite build OK;
      zero-Vue/zero-core. Triple sessions: +tracking-single (5/6). **Remaining:
      manual-control only (the async-capture/recording-drain one) — paused here
      per planner request for the WAVE-4 checkpoint commit.**
    - **2026-07-07 batch 11 (A-P1 migration — manual-control; A-P1 COMPLETE
      6/6).** The trickiest: its idle is an ORDERED ASYNC drain — a capture/
      recording pass may still be reading the stream or awaiting the next
      center-view tick when the last subscriber leaves, so it must fully drain
      BEFORE the view-taps dispose + leases release (V1/§6). Mapped exactly onto
      the scope's LIFO drain + AWAITED async cleanups: registration reverse of
      the drain sequence → drain runs loop.stop → triple=null+ready:false →
      `await Promise.all([recording.stop(), capture.waitIdle()])` (taps still
      live) → taps.dispose → workers.cancel → releaseLeases; idle hook resets
      width/height after. `drained()` now awaits the real settle (multi-window
      switch waits for it). `busy()` probe unchanged (capture/recording refusal).
      session-drain.test stays green (exercises the async idle). Gates: vue-tsc
      0; vitest 284/284; vite build OK; orch zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0.
      Behavior-preserving; **hardware-facing — code-verified only.** **A-P1 DONE:
      all 6 triple sessions (drift, distortion, multi-fovea, calibrate-extrinsic,
      tracking-single, manual-control) on `defineResourceSession`.** Ready for
      verify + commit — closes A-P1.

- **A-24 — WS1 LIVE CUT-OVER (real-1c + 1d): flip the live preview + tracking onto
  the free-running threads. THE milestone integration. PLAN-FIRST (high blast
  radius — it breaks the live path; green-lit per the converge-at-milestone
  posture). Priority over A-P1 manual-control.**
  - **Phase 1 — staging plan (reply in your log / SendMessage-to-main-equivalent;
    NO execution).** Read B's + C's cut-over handoffs (their logs) + the current
    `registry.ts` producer loop, `StreamView`, the tracking session
    (`AsyncKcfTracker`), and `system.ts` perfSnapshot. Propose: the STAGING (I
    expect ~3 stages — SHM producer cut-over, KCF cut-over, probe splice), exactly
    what breaks at each stage, what's verifiable without hardware (synthetic pipe /
    unit tests) vs RIG-GATED, and the rollback story. Stop for my review.
  - **Phase 2 — execute (after my go):**
    1. **SHM producer:** in `registry.ts`, replace the JS per-frame SHM write
       (nextSlot/convert/publish/copyTo/release) with: on shared-camera acquire →
       advertise a `camera:<serial>` pipe (BGRA8 `PipeSpec`) via C's
       `pipeSession().advertise` + `Aravis.attachCameraPipe(lease.camera, pipeId)`;
       on release → `detachCameraPipe` + `unadvertise`. Renderer `StreamView`
       connects to the pipe via C's `pipe-consumer` (react to `state.pipes`)
       instead of `useSession().frame()`. Preserve the in-process vision view-taps
       (co-subscribers — unaffected).
    2. **KCF:** retire the JS `AsyncKcfTracker` → `const tk = Tracker.createTracker(
       centerLease.camera); tk.arm(roi); for await (const r of tk) publish(r.bbox);
       tk.release()` on teardown.
    3. **Instrumentation:** splice C's `Pipe.probeAll()` + `tk.probe()` into
       `perfSnapshot.workloads` (`system.ts` — the C-6 handoff site).
  - **Ownership.** `registry.ts`, `StreamView.vue`, the tracking session,
    `system.ts` — all A. Call C's `pipe-session`/`PipeHub` + B's `attachCameraPipe`/
    `createTracker` across their interfaces (don't modify them).
  - **DoD (Phase 2).** vue-tsc 0, `vitest run`, `vite build`, orchestrator
    zero-Vue, renderer zero-core, V11 if a preload is touched. The freeze-gone /
    ~60fps / `loopLag`<5ms / `maxInterval`-flat proof is the **USER's rig pass**
    (Stage F) — flag every rig-gated surface; do not claim live perf.

    - **PHASE 1 — STAGING PLAN (2026-07-07; no execution, for planner review).**
      Read B-16/B-17 (attachCameraPipe seam + `Tracker.createTracker`/1d KCF
      thread — both camera-free-verified) and C-19/C-20 (collapsed publisher →
      `Publisher::offer` seqlock-writes SHM on B's producer thread; dynamic pipe
      lifecycle: `pipeSession()` → `{advertise(spec)→epoch, unadvertise(id)}`,
      reactive `state.pipes: Record<id,PipeAdvert{spec,epoch}>`, `connectPipe→
      PipeHandle`, `createPipeConsumer(handle,io,sink)`, `Pipe.probeAll()`).
      Current A surfaces confirmed: registry JS loop does BOTH the SHM preview
      write (`shmWriter/nextSlot/frame.view→slot/publish`→`s.sinks`/onFrame) AND
      the in-process BGRA view-taps (`s.viewSinks`/onView, copied from the slot);
      raw-preview `onFrame` consumers = manage-cameras, calibrate-intrinsic,
      single-capture (+welcome); processed vision frames ride `onView`→
      `s.frame()` (untouched). tracking session = `AsyncKcfTracker` in the center
      frame-worker. `system.ts` splices `workloads: workloadsSnapshot()`.

      **STAGE 1 — SHM producer cut-over (real-1c), two coordinated halves.**
      *1a orchestrator (registry.ts + orchestrator index):* on shared-camera
      acquire → `advertise({id:"camera:<serial>", BGRA8 geom})` +
      `Aravis.attachCameraPipe(lease.camera, pipeId)`; on last release →
      `detachCameraPipe` + `unadvertise`; DELETE the JS SHM write (shmWriter/
      nextSlot/view→slot/publish + the `s.sinks`/`emit("shm")` path); KEEP the JS
      loop for view-taps but convert `frame.view("BGRA8", tapView)` DIRECTLY (no
      slot) and start it only when `viewSinks` non-empty; live-wire `pipeSession`
      into the orchestrator hub. *1b renderer (StreamView + the raw-preview
      modules):* swap `session.frame(serial)` for a pipe consumer — discover
      `camera:<serial>` from reactive `state.pipes`, `connectPipe`,
      `createPipeConsumer(handle, io=preload readPipe, sink→FramePayload ref)`,
      feed StreamView; reconnect on epoch bump, clear on CLOSED.
      **Breaks:** raw camera preview ONLY, and only in the window between 1a and
      1b — land them together (or a one-flag guard). Processed vision frames,
      recorder (consumes `camera.stream` directly), and calibration overlays are
      UNAFFECTED. **Verifiable no-HW:** advertise/attach/detach orchestration
      (fake broker + fake `attachCameraPipe`) → acquire=advertise+attach,
      release=detach+unadvertise, epoch; renderer bind (fake `PipeReaderIO` +
      C's deterministic `poll()`); B/C loopback tests already green
      (11-capture-pipe fake-cam attach→BGRA readback, pipe-consumer resize).
      **RIG-GATED:** freeze-gone/~60fps/loopLag<5ms/maxInterval-flat = user
      Stage-F. **Rollback:** the JS write + onFrame path is a self-contained
      block; revert = restore it + repoint StreamView to `session.frame()`
      (uncommitted → `git restore` registry.ts + the raw-preview modules).

      **STAGE 2 — KCF cut-over (1d), tracking session only.** Replace
      `AsyncKcfTracker` with `const tk = Tracker.createTracker(centerLease.camera)`;
      `tk.arm(roi)` on startTracker/steer; a scope-registered `for await (const r
      of tk) publish(r.bbox/target)` loop; `tk.release()` on teardown (scope.defer
      — ties into the A-P1 scope I just landed on this session). The center
      frame-worker keeps undistort/slice/publish for DISPLAY; only the JS
      `kcf.update` call is removed (KCF now on B's Sub::Latest native thread).
      **Breaks:** tracking-single's tracker only. **Verifiable no-HW:** A-side
      wiring with a fake Tracker stub (async-iterable + arm/release spies) →
      arm-on-select, publish-on-yield, release-on-idle, no-leak-on-reactivate
      (A-P1 scope); B's 12-kcf-tracker (fake-cam, drops-on-stall) already proves
      the thread. **RIG-GATED:** tracking accuracy/latency/60fps = user rig.
      **Rollback:** localized to tracking session.ts; `AsyncKcfTracker` retired
      only after proven — revert restores it.

      **STAGE 3 — probe splice (system.ts).** `workloads: { ...workloadsSnapshot(),
      ...Pipe.probeAll(), ...(tk-live ? { "tracking:kcf": tk.probe() } : {}) }` —
      both native probes already in the `WorkloadSnapshot` shape (C/B built them
      so; my optional `maxIntervalMs` from A-23 batch 6 accommodates them).
      **Breaks:** nothing (additive). **Verifiable no-HW:** unit-test the merge
      with fake probe outputs. **RIG-GATED:** the live maxInterval numbers.
      **Rollback:** remove the spread (one line).

      **Sequencing:** Stages 1 and 2 are independent; recommend 1 (flagship
      freeze fix) → 2 → 3 (or fold each probe into its stage). **OPEN QUESTIONS
      for review (before Phase 2):** (Q1) confirm the JS registry loop stays a
      co-subscriber for `onView` taps (direct `frame.view` convert), native
      CaptureSink owns the SHM write — or do view-taps also move? (Q2)
      `attachCameraPipe` timing — on acquire (advertise+attach together) vs first
      `connectPipe` (B's "subscribe lazily starts stream"); how it composes with
      C's connectPipe refcount + unadvertise. (Q3) want a reusable renderer
      `usePipeFrame(pipeId)` composable (state.pipes→connectPipe→consumer→ref) so
      raw-preview call sites swap uniformly, or per-module? (Q4) confirm the
      StreamView→pipe swap is raw-camera surfaces ONLY (processed L/C/R stay on
      `session.frame`). (Q5) milestone scope — static `camera:<serial>` + KCF
      only, or also cut multi-fovea onto dynamic `fovea:<...>` pipes now?
      Stopping for your review — no code changed.
    - **PHASE 2 — STAGE 1a LANDED (orchestrator SHM producer cut-over; 2026-07-07).**
      Split Stage 1 into two software-green sub-checkpoints (the 1a+1b "pair" is a
      RIG constraint — software gates don't render live frames — so 1a alone is
      green; **flagging: both must land before the user's rig pass or raw previews
      are dark**). *1a = orchestrator.* `registry.ts`: injected `RegistryPipeSeam`
      (`advertise/unadvertise/attach/detach` — set from the index; keeps registry
      native-free + testable); on shared-camera acquire → `advertiseCameraPipe`
      (BGRA8 `camera:<serial>` spec from GenICam `getFeature("Width"/"Height")`) +
      `attach`; on last release → `retireCameraPipe` (detach→unadvertise); DELETED
      the JS SHM write (shmWriter/nextSlot/slot-publish/`onFrame`/`s.sinks`/
      `emit("shm")`); the JS loop is now VIEW-TAP ONLY (`frame.view("BGRA8",
      tapView)` direct) and `hasConsumers`=viewSinks — a preview-only camera
      (manage-cameras) runs NO JS loop → fully off-loop (the freeze fix,
      rig-gated). `index.ts`: wired C's `pipeSession(asBroker(Pipe))` into the hub
      + `setRegistryPipeSeam` (Aravis pipe NAPIs cast — not in d.ts yet, B-owned).
      Dropped the raw-preview `onFrame` publishes in manage-cameras/
      calibrate-intrinsic/single-capture sessions (vision `onView` taps
      untouched). NEW `test/registry-pipe.test.ts` (2, fake seam+camera): advertise
      = correct BGRA8 geometry + attach-after-advertise; retire = detach→
      unadvertise. Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 279/279 (+2); vite build OK; orch
      zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0. **RIG-GATED (user Stage-F):** freeze-gone/
      fps/loopLag — no live claim. Retired JS SHM write is in the prior commit
      (rollback = git restore). **NEXT: Stage 1b** (renderer `usePipeFrame`
      composable + repoint manage-cameras/calibrate-intrinsic/single-capture/
      welcome StreamViews from `session.frame` to `camera:<serial>` pipes) — the
      other half of the pair; then Stage 2 (KCF), 3 (probe).
    - **PHASE 2 — STAGE 1b LANDED (renderer pipe binding; 2026-07-07). STAGE 1
      COMPLETE (1a+1b pair).** NEW `usePipeFrame(pipeId)` in `client.ts`
      (A-owned): `useSession(pipes, "pipes")` → watches a primitive `id#epoch`
      key off reactive `state.pipes` → `connectPipe` → C's `createPipeConsumer(
      handle, pipeReaderIO, sink→ref)` (pixels ride the shared segment via the
      shm client's `readPipe`/`releaseBuffer` C-15 pool) → reconnects on epoch
      bump (C-20 reuse-safe id), tears down (stop + `disconnectPipe` + clear) on
      un-advertise / switch / scope-dispose; supports static or ref/getter
      pipeId. Repointed the 4 raw-preview surfaces from `session.frame()`:
      manage-cameras `CameraConfig.vue` (`camera:${serial}`), calibrate-intrinsic
      (`camera:${activeSerial}`), single-capture (`camera:${serial}`),
      WelcomeWindow (dynamic). Processed L/C/R stay on `session.frame` (Q4).
      Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 279/279; vite build OK; renderer zero-core 0; orch
      zero-Vue 0; V11 preload-renderer 0/0 (preload untouched). **Verification:**
      the composable is thin wiring over ALREADY-tested primitives —
      `createPipeConsumer` (C's `pipe-consumer.test`, fake `PipeReaderIO`+`poll`),
      `useSession`/`state.pipes`/`connectPipe` (C's `pipe-session.test`); no
      dedicated composable test since `usePipeFrame` calls `useSession`
      same-module (unmockable), and vue-tsc pins the wiring types. **RIG-GATED
      (user Stage-F):** actual live rendering off the pipes (real cameras + B's
      native producer) — no live claim. **Minor UX flag:** raw-preview
      StreamViews now pass no `:source`, so their expand button falls back to
      element-fullscreen (not a projection window) — pipe-based projection is a
      later add if wanted. **Stage 1 ready for your verify + commit (1a+1b as the
      pair); then Stage 2 (KCF), 3 (probe).**
    - **PHASE 2 — STAGE 2 LANDED (KCF cut-over; 2026-07-07).** Retired the JS
      `AsyncKcfTracker` in the tracking session → B's native `Tracker`:
      `tk = createTracker(t.leases.C.camera)` in activate (folded into the A-P1
      scope — `scope.defer(() => tk.release())` so `drained()` awaits it);
      `armAt(center)` → `tk.arm(roi)` on target select (raw-sensor box via the
      undistort round-trip); a fire-and-forget `consumeTracker` loop
      (`for await`) fans results to found/lost. Removed the JS KCF machinery
      (`kcf.init/update`, `searchWindow`, `pendingInit`, busy-drop, generation
      guard — now intrinsic to the native latest-wins thread) + the `cvtColor`/
      `AsyncKcfTracker` imports. The center frame-worker keeps DISPLAY only
      (undistort + publish "C"/"center"); `disengage`/`kcf.active` → an `armed`
      JS gate (no native disarm — thread runs last roi until release; v1). NEW
      testable `tracker-consume.ts` (`consumeTrackerResults`) + `test/
      tracker-consume.test.ts` (2, fake Tracker async-iterable): found/lost fan
      + ends-on-release + armed-gate. Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 281/281 (+2); vite
      build OK; orch zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0. **RIG-GATED (user
      Stage-F), flag:** (1) **coordinate mapping** — native KCF runs on the RAW
      center frame, so `undistortedCenter(bbox)` maps its box to the undistorted
      actuation/slice space; the undistort flags + `armAt` round-trip need rig
      verification (accuracy). (2) tracking accuracy + ~60fps — no live claim.
      (3) `perf.trackMs` telemetry now reports 0 (KCF latency is native-only →
      shows up via the Stage-3 probe). **Left intact (not deleted):**
      `@orchestrator/async-kcf` + its unit test — unused by production now; safe
      to remove in a follow-up. **Stage 2 ready for verify + commit; then Stage 3
      (probe splice — `Pipe.probeAll()` + `tk.probe()` into `perfSnapshot.workloads`).**
    - **PHASE 2 — STAGE 3 LANDED (probe splice; 2026-07-07). A-24 LIVE CUT-OVER
      COMPLETE (Stages 1+2+3, software-green).** NEW A-owned `native-probes.ts`
      (`registerNativeProbe(source)→dispose` / `nativeProbes()` — merges native
      `WorkloadSnapshot` batches, throwing probe skipped) so `system.ts` stays
      `core`-free + vitest-testable. `system.ts` perfSnapshot: `workloads: {
      ...workloadsSnapshot(), ...nativeProbes() }`. Index injects C's
      `Pipe.probeAll()` (`ProbeSnapshot` === `WorkloadSnapshot` structurally →
      direct). Tracking session registers its KCF probe via a `TrackerMeter`→
      `WorkloadSnapshot` adapter (`uptimeMs`→`window`, `dropTotal`→`drops`;
      `WorkloadStat` inputs fit the A-23 optional-`maxIntervalMs`
      `WorkloadStreamStat`), scope-registered → disposed on drain (absent when
      idle — no stale rows). NEW `test/native-probes.test.ts` (3): registry
      merge+dispose+throw-skip, AND the end-to-end splice through the REAL system
      session (fake probe → `perfSnapshot.workloads` includes the native stream).
      Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 284/284 (+3); vite build OK; orch zero-Vue 0;
      renderer zero-core 0. **RIG-GATED (user Stage-F):** the live
      `maxInterval`-flat / drops-sane / utilization numbers are the user's rig
      read — the SPLICE mechanism is proven, the perf numbers are not claimed.
      **A-24 done: raw preview + KCF on free-running native threads, both probed
      into the profiler. Ready for verify + commit of Stage 3.**

## Coder B — Native core, protocol & firmware

Owns `core` native code (except the SHM substrate), `firmware/**`, and
the protocol-v2 host+MCU surface — the synced-capture lineage: bench
readiness, P3.1a/P4/P5 when hardware returns, FIN-trace diagnostics,
tracker/controller/dispatcher native work. The former "finisher" role is
retired: each coder fixes planner findings in their own area; quality
control is the planner's review loop.

- **B-16 — WS1 real-1c B-side: Aravis capture → C's producer sink (the C↔B seam;
  milestone). DESIGN-FIRST — the cross-role crux.** C-19 moves the SHM producer
  into a free-running C++ thread; the frames come from your Aravis surface.
  - **Phase 1 — design sketch (reply via SendMessage; no build yet; converges with
    C's producer-sink interface, which I'll relay).** Survey your Aravis
    `Camera`/`Stream`/`Frame` native code and propose:
    1. **Thread-boundary recommendation.** WHO owns the capture thread?
       **My lean (rule unless you make a strong Aravis-safety case otherwise): B
       owns a capture thread** that `arv_stream_timeout_pop_buffer`s, converts via
       `Frame::view`/cvtColor into a REUSABLE BGRA buffer (persistent, no per-frame
       alloc/thread-spawn), **releases the Aravis buffer** (honoring the extract-
       before-release hazard — [[feedback_frame_release]]), then `offer()`s the
       BGRA buffer to C's producer sink (latest-wins single slot). This keeps ALL
       Aravis buffer lifecycle inside B and hands C ready bytes → C's publisher
       stays raw-memcpy convert-agnostic. The alternative (C's thread calls B pop+
       convert APIs) drags Aravis lifecycle into C-owned code — argue for it only
       if there's a real reason.
    2. **The exact frame the sink receives** (BGRA8 buffer ptr + w/h + stride +
       FrameMeta) — must match C's `offer(...)` signature (C posts it; I relay so
       you converge, don't guess).
    3. Where this hooks per shared camera (start/stop with the pipe lifecycle), and
       how the existing in-process view-tap consumers (vision) still get frames.
  - **Phase 2 — build (after I reconcile your sketch with C's interface).** The
    capture thread + convert + release + offer, metered via C's `ThreadMeter`
    (C grants/owns it; you instantiate one for the `camera` capture stream). No
    `registry.ts` (A's cut-over). Aravis per-process exclusivity is satisfied (the
    thread is in-process).
  - **Ownership.** Your Aravis `Camera`/`Stream`/`Frame` (`core/**` B-side). C owns
    `Pipe`/`ThreadMeter` (call across the interface). `registry.ts` is A.
  - **DoD (Phase 2).** `core make build` both runtimes; a no-hardware test if the
    capture path can be driven by a fake/loopback Aravis source (else compile-
    verified + a clear note that live capture is rig-gated); frame-release hazard
    respected (convert before release). The rig pass is the user's milestone check.
  - Log: **Phase 1 (design, accepted) + Phase 2 (build) DONE — compile + no-
    hardware-loopback verified; live capture rig-gated (Stage F).**
    **Seam (as reconciled with C's `Pipe.h`):** B already owns the per-camera
    capture thread — the base `Stream<Frame::Ptr>` thread (`iterate()` pops the
    ArvBuffer, `Frame::create` COPIES it out, `push_buffer` releases it, then
    fans `Frame::Ptr` to subscribers). NEW B-owned `Arv::CaptureSink`
    (`core/lib/Aravis/CaptureSink.{h,cpp}`) is one more `Subscriber` on that
    thread: converts `frame->raw`→BGRA8 into a REUSABLE `cv::Mat` (no per-frame
    alloc) via `cvtColorCode(fmt,BGRA8)` and `offer()`s to C's
    `FrameSink` (`PipeHub::sink(id)`). Vision view-taps = co-subscribers,
    untouched. **Frame-release hazard structural:** raw is a heap copy + the
    ArvBuffer is back in Aravis's pool before any subscriber runs — feedPipe
    never touches Aravis memory.
    **Contract filled:** `FrameInfo{width,height,channels=4,stride=dst.step,
    bytes=w*h*4 (tight = bytesPerFrame)}`; `ShmRing::FrameMeta{tCapture(now),
    convertMs(measured),deviceTimestamp,systemTimestamp}` from `Frame`. Size
    guard: a frame whose W×H≠pipe geometry is DROPPED (not offered) — A
    re-advertises. **Metering:** no separate `ThreadMeter` — post-collapse C's
    `Publisher::offer()` records its own meter (incl. the `convertMs` I pass) on
    my producer thread, per C's `Pipe.h`. **Construction pattern:** subscribe-in-
    ctor + `Shared<CaptureSink>::create` (mirrors `Sub::Latest`/`Queue`); dtor
    `close()`s before `stream_` releases.
    **No-hardware test:** added a B test hook `Aravis.feedTestFrame(pipeId,
    srcFormat,fill)` (forward-declared in `Addon.cpp` to dodge the Aravis global
    `Object` vs `Napi::Object` clash) + `core/test/11-capture-pipe.ts`: advertise
    BGRA8 pipe → connect → feed synthetic Mono8 → reader reads back BGRA8
    (GRAY→BGRA: B=G=R=fill, A=255) + meta.deviceTimestamp. Runs green.
    **HANDOFF TO A (cut-over, 1c):** A's registry constructs a
    `Arv::CaptureSink::create(Stream::get(camera), PipeHub::sink(pipeId),
    w, h)` on pipe-connect and drops the `Ptr` on disconnect (subscribe lazily
    starts / unsubscribe pauses the Stream thread). A needs a JS→C++ construct
    seam (a NAPI attach, analogous to C's `attachSynthetic`) — I can add
    `Aravis.attachCameraPipe(serial,pipeId)`/`detach` when you green-light (kept
    out of this build since it's A's cut-over wiring).
    **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓; `core/test/11-capture-pipe.ts`
    green (no-hardware loopback); `09-pipe.ts` green (C's path unregressed after
    the `Addon.cpp` edit); reader addon `otool -L` system-libs-only (0 opencv/
    aravis/glib — I didn't touch it). NOT hardware-verified (Stage F milestone
    is the user's rig check). Did NOT touch `registry.ts`, C's `Pipe`/
    `ThreadMeter`/reader.

- **B-17 — (1) the `attachCameraPipe` cut-over glue [build now], then (2) 1d KCF
  tracker thread [design-first].**
  - **Part 1 — `attachCameraPipe` NAPI seam (build now; unblocks A's cut-over).**
    The JS→C++ construct seam your B-16 handoff named: a NAPI that, on pipe
    connect, does `Arv::CaptureSink::create(Stream::get(camera), PipeHub::sink(
    pipeId), w, h)` and returns a handle A drops on disconnect (analogous to C's
    `attachSynthetic`). A calls it from the cut-over. **`core/addon.cpp` is a
    shared NAPI-registration hub — APPEND your registration; do NOT modify C's
    pipe registrations (C-20 is editing addon.cpp concurrently).** DoD: `core make
    build` both runtimes; extend `11-capture-pipe.ts` (or a small test) to drive
    attach→frames→detach camera-free; reader `otool -L` clean.
  - **Part 2 — 1d: KCF tracker → its own free-running C++ thread (DESIGN-FIRST,
    reply via SendMessage, no build).** The milestone's second thread
    ([[project_async_kcf_cpp_thread]]): the center-camera KCF moves OFF the JS
    event loop into a dedicated C++ thread consuming the LATEST camera frame,
    results back via async generator; instrumented by C's standalone `ThreadMeter`
    (granted, probed out-of-loop — reuse it, don't fork). Sketch: how the KCF
    thread gets the latest frame (another `Subscriber` on the existing Aravis
    stream keeping latest-wins, like `CaptureSink`? or off the pipe?), how results
    return to the orchestrator (async generator seam), the `ThreadMeter`
    integration, and what A must wire (the tracking session's KCF call site).
    Stop at the sketch for my review.
  - **Ownership.** Your Aravis/`Tracker` (`core/**` B) + `addon.cpp` (shared-
    append). Call C's `PipeHub`/`ThreadMeter` across the interface, don't modify.
    `registry.ts`/tracking session are A.
  - Log:
    - **Part 1 (attachCameraPipe seam) — LANDED, camera-free end-to-end
      verified.** `core/lib/Aravis/CaptureSink.cpp`: `attachCameraPipe(camera,
      pipeId)` unwraps A's SHARED lease (`convert<Arv::Camera::Ptr>`) →
      `Stream::get(camera)` (idempotent — reuses the one stream preview/vision
      already share; Aravis per-process exclusivity honored) → `PipeHub::sink(
      pipeId)` + `spec()` geometry → `CaptureSink::create(...)`, stored in a
      B-owned `map<pipeId, CaptureSink::Ptr>` (1:1). `detachCameraPipe(pipeId)`
      drops the Ptr OUTSIDE the lock (unsubscribe may block) → returns whether
      one existed (idempotent). Registered by APPENDING to `core/addon.cpp`
      (forward-declared; did NOT touch C-20's pipe registrations). **Test:** the
      seam is now driven END-TO-END camera-free via Aravis's built-in fake
      camera — added `Aravis.enableFakeCamera()` (`arv_enable_interface("Fake")`);
      `core/test/11-capture-pipe.ts` now: enableFakeCamera → list → advertise a
      BGRA8 pipe at the fake cam's 512×512 → connect → `attachCameraPipe` → reads
      real Mono8→BGRA8-converted frames off the live Arv::Stream (asserts B==G==R,
      A==255 per pixel) → `detachCameraPipe` (idempotent). **Gates:** `core make
      build` both runtimes ✓; `11-capture-pipe.ts` green (loopback + fake-camera
      attach/detach); `09-pipe.ts` green (C's path unregressed after the addon
      append); reader `otool -L` 0 non-system deps. **A cut-over:** call
      `Aravis.attachCameraPipe(lease.camera, pipeId)` on pipe-connect,
      `detachCameraPipe(pipeId)` on disconnect.
    - **Part 2 (1d KCF thread) — LANDED (design approved; v1 full-frame),
      camera-free verified.** The milestone's SECOND thread. NEW
      `KcfTrackerStream : TransformStream<Arv::Frame::Ptr, TrackResult::Ptr>`
      (core/src/Tracker.cpp): its base `Stream<TrackResult::Ptr>` thread pulls
      the LATEST center-camera frame via the built-in `Sub::Latest` (latest-wins,
      drop-stale — a co-subscriber on the shared Arv::Stream, NOT off the BGRA
      pipe) and runs FULL-FRAME `cv::TrackerKCF::update` OFF the JS loop.
      `transform` = meter ingest + (drop delta) + begin/update/end + emit; `arm(
      roi)` (re-)inits KCF on the next frame (lazy, JS-callable). Results stream
      to JS via the standard async-generator seam — `KcfTrackerObject`
      (CoreObject) exposes `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` (a `Sub::Queue` on the
      stream, exactly like `StreamObject`), `arm`, `probe`, `stall`(test);
      `Tracker.createTracker(camera)` factory (registered via
      `exportTrackerNamespace` — **addon.cpp untouched by 1d**). Typed in
      `core/dist/Tracker/index.d.ts` (`Tracker`/`TrackResult`/`TrackerMeter`/
      `createTracker`). **Meter:** reuses C's `Meter::ThreadMeter` (single writer
      = transform thread; probed out-of-loop → same shape as the pipe producer,
      splices into `perfSnapshot.workloads`). **Drop counter (as flagged):**
      added `droppedCount()` to `Sub::Latest` (counts overwrites of unconsumed
      frames) + `TransformStream::upstreamDrops()`; `transform` meters the delta
      via `meter_.drop()` — the "KCF can't keep up" signal.
      **Test** `core/test/12-kcf-tracker.ts` (fake camera, camera-free): steady
      state → 5 streamed results, frames/tracks/busyMs/interval metered,
      drops=0; then `stall(120ms)` (> the ~45ms fake-cam interval) → the camera
      outruns KCF and **drops climb 0 → 12** (drop signal proven). **Gates:**
      `core make build` both runtimes ✓; `12-kcf-tracker` + `08/09/10/11` all
      PASS unsandboxed; reader `otool -L` 0 non-system deps. v1 tracking
      accuracy/cost is RIG-GATED (Stage-F milestone pass). **Follow-up:** port
      the JS search-window crop into `transform` (perf; v1 is full-frame).
      **HANDOFF TO A (tracking-single cut-over):** replace the JS
      `AsyncKcfTracker` with `const tk = Tracker.createTracker(centerLease.camera)`;
      `tk.arm(roi)` on target select/re-init; `for await (const r of tk)
      publish(r.bbox)`; `tk.release()` on teardown; splice `tk.probe()` into
      `system.perfSnapshot.workloads` at the 1 Hz throttle (same as the pipe
      producer). `registry.ts`/the tracking session stay A's.

## Coder C — SHM frame path (end-to-end)

Sole owner of Stage 4: ShmRing substrate, reader addon, registry
producer path, preload/client SHM transport, SHM OSD, and
their tests. Absorbs the SHM follow-ups previously listed under Coder B
— including the ping-pong pool. Hard rules: SHM is the canonical preview
transport where eligible; descriptors ride the existing Channel machinery;
reader addon never links OpenCV/Aravis/GLib/libusb; scope is
transport-only preview frames (no processed/capture/raw frames without
planner dispatch); no PB2/perf claims without a live display+cameras
session.

### Active instructions

- **(C-18 max-interval diagnostic accepted & archived 2026-07-07 → refactor-plan.md; A handoff: `maxIntervalMs` on the workload stream-stat type in stats.ts/contracts.ts — filed to A.)**

- **(C-17 pipe-consumer stack accepted & archived 2026-07-07 → refactor-plan.md.)**

- **C-19 — WS1 real-1c: the MILESTONE driver. Separate the SHM producer into its
  own C++ thread, FREE from the orchestrator JS event loop, WITH a native
  instrumentation meter the orchestrator probes out-of-loop. GREEN-LIT to break
  the live SHM preview path (posture: converge at the milestone).**
  - **Phase 1 — SEAM REVIEW (stop for my go; this is architecture + cross-role).**
    Reply via SendMessage with:
    1. **Camera→producer→publisher seam.** How a camera frame reaches the C++
       publisher thread so the per-frame memcpy+seqlock runs OFF the JS loop.
       Evaluate the options against the CURRENT Aravis/registry reality (frames
       arrive in the orchestrator process; `project-orchestrator-camera-
       exclusivity`): e.g. (a) camera acquisition into a C++ capture thread feeding
       the publisher; (b) the existing camera NAPI frame handed to the publisher
       via a lock-free single-slot handoff (JS still triggers the handoff but does
       NOT do the memcpy/seqlock). State which, and exactly what the JS loop still
       touches per frame (goal: nothing but a pointer handoff, ideally not even
       that).
    2. **Native thread meter = the instrumentation API** (`project-thread-
       instrumentation-api`, milestone deliverable). How the C++ publisher thread
       records the C-18 metric block (maxIntervalMs 10×1 s bins + rate/util/drops)
       lock-free, and how the orchestrator PROBES it out-of-loop (reads the block,
       never per-frame) to fold into `perfSnapshot.workloads` — SAME schema C-18
       defined (`WorkloadStreamStat`/`INTERVAL_WINDOW`), so the profiler renders a
       native producer stream identically to a JS one.
    3. **Cross-role A-side (flag, don't do):** removing the live JS SHM write from
       `registry.ts` (A-owned), handing frames to your producer, live-wiring
       `pipe-session` into the orchestrator index, StreamView→pipe binding. List
       exactly what A must do; I sequence it with A (A is mid-A-P1) — you build the
       C-side against a test driver first.
  - **Phase 2 — BUILD (after my go).** Implement the C-side per the approved seam:
    the producer/publisher-thread SHM write + the native meter, proven by a native
    test (a driving thread feeds frames → publisher writes SHM off that thread →
    a consumer reads them; the native meter records intervals and a probe reads
    the metric block; inject a stall → the probed `maxIntervalMs` spikes). The live
    registry cut-over is the coordinated A-side follow-up — DON'T touch
    `registry.ts` yourself.
  - **Ownership.** `core/**` pipe substrate (C grant), `pipe-session.ts`,
    `pipe-consumer.ts`. `registry.ts` is A — handoff only. Native meter: new
    C-owned core file (grant it like Pipe.h/.cpp — note it in your seam sketch).
  - **DoD (Phase 2).** `core make build` both runtimes; reader `otool -L` clean;
    the new native producer-thread + meter test PASS unsandboxed; `09-pipe` still
    PASS; JS gates for any orchestrator-JS you own. The rig pass (freeze gone /
    ~60 fps / loopLag<5 ms / producer `maxInterval` flat) is the USER's milestone
    verification — you prove the mechanism, not the perf number.
  - Log: **Phase 2 DONE (C-side, against the test driver).** Mechanism proven;
    live registry cut-over is A's follow-up.
    - **Reconciled with B's finding → COLLAPSED the publisher thread.** B's
      per-camera Aravis capture thread (single-consumer pop) already runs off
      the JS loop, so a separate publisher thread is redundant: `Publisher::
      offer()` now seqlock-writes the frame DIRECTLY into the next ring slot ON
      the producer's thread (row-by-row, honoring stride), one copy, no extra
      thread, no ping-pong. Removed the C-16 thread/cv/pending handoff.
    - **Locked producer-sink interface (sent to B, ratify):** `FrameSink::
      offer(const void* data, const FrameInfo& info, const ShmRing::FrameMeta&
      meta)`; `FrameInfo{width,height,channels,stride,bytes}`; `Publisher`
      implements it; a C++ producer gets its sink via `PipeHub::instance().
      sink(id)`. offer() copies synchronously (B reuses 1 BGRA buffer); arbitrary
      stride accepted; size mismatch → drop + pipe re-advertise; FrameMeta v2 =
      {tCapture,convertMs,device/systemTimestamp} (captureSeq = a v3 follow-up).
    - **Native meter — NEW C-owned `core/include/ThreadMeter.h` +
      `core/src/ThreadMeter.cpp` (granted).** Standalone (1d KCF reuses it).
      SINGLE-WRITER (the producer thread, via offer) + SEQLOCK read: even/odd
      `version` + retry-on-torn (same as the SHM ring); the probe copies the POD
      block and computes on the copy at `now` (rotate-on-copy → correct aging +
      live in-progress stall). C-18 bin-ring (10×1 s) ported to C++, `ingest/
      emit/addBusy/drop`. `Publisher` owns one (`pipe:<id>`, in `frame`, out
      `shm`); records ingest+convert-busy at offer, emit on write.
    - **Probe out-of-loop:** NAPI `Pipe.probe(id)` seqlock-reads the block →
      a JS object in the EXACT `WorkloadSnapshot` shape (`window`, utilization,
      busyMs, inputs/outputs:{[s]:{count,ratePerSec,maxIntervalMs}}, drops) →
      the orchestrator folds it into `perfSnapshot.workloads` and the profiler
      renders a native producer stream identically to a JS one. `Pipe.
      injectStall(id,ms)` test hook. Added to the `core/Pipe` d.ts + glue.
    - **Native test** NEW `core/test/10-pipe-thread-meter.ts`: SyntheticProducer
      thread feeds → publisher seqlock-writes SHM off that thread → reader-addon
      consumer reads 10 frames (correct bytes/seq) → probe steady
      `maxIntervalMs`<100 ms → `injectStall(200)` → probed `maxIntervalMs`≥150 ms
      (and > steady). **PASS unsandboxed.**
    - **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes CLEAN; reader `otool -L`
      (electron+node) = self+libc++.1+libSystem.B ONLY; `10-pipe-thread-meter`,
      `09-pipe` (collapse regression-free), `08-shm-ring` (live path) all PASS
      unsandboxed; vue-tsc **0**; vitest **275/275** (no orchestrator-JS changed
      in C-19; incl. A/B parallel landings). Not committed. NO perf claim (rig =
      user's 1e).
    - **Cross-role (flag, sequenced by you):** A — delete registry.ts JS SHM
      write, start/stop B's capture producer per shared camera + advertise
      `camera:<serial>` pipes, live-wire `pipe-session` into the orchestrator
      index, StreamView→pipe binding, splice `Pipe.probe()` into
      `perfSnapshot.workloads`. B — the Aravis `Camera` capture-subscriber that
      converts BGRA and `offer()`s to `PipeHub::instance().sink(pipeId)`
      (interface above, locked). `registry.ts` untouched by me.

- **C-20 — WS1 pipe protocol: DYNAMIC LIFECYCLE (user 2026-07-07). Design the
  protocol for fovea streams created/destroyed/resized on the fly, before the
  cut-over bakes in a static-set assumption. DESIGN-FIRST (contract-affecting).**
  - **Context.** `refactor-plan.md` §"WS1 pipe protocol — DYNAMIC LIFECYCLE".
    Multi-fovea tracking churns pipes continuously (create/destroy on interaction
    + scene change; each fovea resizes as it tracks). Your C-16/17/19 protocol
    advertises + symmetric-closes but has no live DISCOVERY channel and a
    recreate-per-resize size policy — both need rework for churn.
  - **Phase 1 — seam sketch (reply via SendMessage; no build).** Audit the current
    protocol against churn and propose:
    1. **Consumer discovery** — a subscribable advertise/un-advertise stream so the
       renderer learns of pipes appearing/disappearing at runtime (not a one-time
       `pipes` read). Where it lives (pipe-contract/pipe-session), the event shape,
       and how a late-joining consumer gets the current set + deltas.
    2. **Cheap, leak-free churn** — create/destroy many pipes fast; prove no leaked
       shm segments (shm_unlink on drop) / threads (collapse already = no
       thread-per-pipe); any pooling/bounding.
    3. **Resize policy** — replace recreate-per-resize: ring sized to a MAX fovea
       footprint (spec carries `maxBytes`/max w×h) with a varying active w/h inside
       it, or in-place resize up to a cap. Consumers must read the current active
       w/h per frame (frame meta or header field), not assume the spec's nominal.
    4. **Reuse-safe identity** — `fovea:<session>:<id>` with a generation/epoch so a
       consumer on a stale id observes CLOSED and never silently binds a reused id.
    5. Note what the A-side cut-over must do to USE this (advertise/notify wiring)
       and whether it changes the pinned `viewer-contract.ts` (planner-arbitrated).
  - **Phase 2 — build (after my go).** The protocol additions + tests: a churn test
    (create/destroy N pipes rapidly → no leaked segments, discovery events fire),
    a resize test (active w/h varies within a max-sized ring, no segment
    recreation, consumer reads correct bytes), reuse-safe id test (stale consumer
    sees CLOSED). Keep `camera:<serial>` (static, milestone) working unchanged.
  - **Ownership.** C's pipe substrate + `pipe-contract.ts` + `pipe-session.ts` +
    `pipe-consumer.ts` + `Pipe.h/.cpp`. `viewer-contract.ts` change → planner
    handoff. `registry.ts` is A.
  - **DoD (Phase 2).** `core make build` both runtimes; reader `otool -L` clean;
    new churn/resize/identity tests + `09-pipe`/`10-pipe-thread-meter`/`08-shm-ring`
    PASS unsandboxed; JS gates for the contract/consumer changes.
  - Log: **Phase 2 DONE.** Dynamic pipe lifecycle built; `camera:<serial>` +
    09/10/08 unchanged.
    - **Discovery:** `pipe-contract.state.pipes` → keyed
      `Record<pipeId, PipeAdvert{spec, epoch}>` (seeded to every subscriber =
      current set; snapshot-replaced on each advertise/un-advertise = delta —
      the viewer-`files` machinery, N bounded). `pipeSession()` now returns
      `{session, advertise(spec)→epoch, unadvertise(id)}`; A drives churn via
      those, the renderer reacts by diffing the reactive Record.
    - **Leak-free churn:** collapse already = no thread-per-pipe; `Segment` dtor
      `shm_unlink`s. Churn test (20 create/destroy) asserts every dropped
      segment is unlinked (`reader.open` throws). **Pool deferred** (profile-
      gated; all fovea rings share the max footprint → trivially poolable later).
    - **Resize (layout v3):** `SlotHeader` gains per-frame active `width/height`
      (LAYOUT_VERSION 2→3). `PipeSpec` gains `maxWidth/maxHeight/maxBytes` — a
      TUNABLE per-FOVEA cap (small hi-res crop, NOT camera res → N max rings
      stay bounded); the ring is sized to `maxBytes`, `offer()` validates active
      ≤ max, tight-packs the active frame + `publish`es active w/h; the read
      path (`ReadResult`→reader→`PipeReadFrame`→`pipe-consumer`) carries active
      w/h and builds `[h,w]` from it. Resize test: 4×4 then 12×10 in a 16×16
      ring, SAME segment, consumer reads correct bytes.
    - **Reuse-safe identity:** `PipeHub` keeps a per-id `epoch` (= segment
      generation) that PERSISTS across `drop` and bumps on each (re-)advertise →
      a new segment name; `drop` sets CLOSED then unlinks the old. Reuse test: a
      stale consumer on the old segment reads CLOSED, a re-advertise mints
      epoch 2 with a different `shmName`, and the stale consumer never binds the
      new. `PipeHandle.epoch` exposed; `advertise()` returns the epoch.
    - **Probe churn-consistent:** NEW `Pipe.probeAll()` → `{[id]:
      WorkloadSnapshot}` for the LIVE set only (a dropped pipe's meter is
      destroyed → absent; no stale workload rows). `Pipe.offerFrame(id,w,h,byte)`
      test hook. `core/Pipe` d.ts + glue updated.
    - **`viewer-contract.ts` UNTOUCHED** (pipes are the separate C-owned
      `pipe-contract`). Camera pipes byte-identical (max defaults to nominal;
      live `Shm.Writer` passes fixed dims via `publish`'s defaulted args).
    - **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes CLEAN; reader `otool -L`
      self+libc++.1+libSystem.B ONLY; `08-shm-ring`/`09-pipe`/
      `10-pipe-thread-meter` + NEW `11-pipe-lifecycle` (churn/resize/reuse) PASS
      unsandboxed; vue-tsc **0**; vitest **277/277** (pipe-session +1 churn,
      pipe-consumer +1 resize); `vite build` GREEN, renderer 0-core /
      orchestrator 0-Vue, V11 `preload-renderer.cjs` 0/0. Not committed.
    - **A-side cut-over adds:** call `advertise`/`unadvertise` as foveas
      create/destroy, feed active-sized frames on resize, react to `state.pipes`
      in the renderer (bind/unbind + reconnect on epoch bump), and splice
      `Pipe.probeAll()` into `perfSnapshot.workloads`.

## WS1 real-1e — modular per-stream converter threads (DESIGN-FIRST)

Full design: `docs/refactor/proposals/converter-threads.md` (read it fully).
User directive (2026-07-07): the format converter must be a modular reusable
component; run on a dedicated thread attached to each stream's output; selected
by a modifier on the stream/pipe request; producer threads idle when no pipe is
open. Idle-when-no-pipe is FREE via the `Stream` base auto-park (confirmed) —
do not hand-roll lifecycle. Model on `KcfTrackerStream` (the existing
`TransformStream` free-running-thread template).

- **B-18 — converter core (PLAN-FIRST; post a design sketch + questions before
  building).** Owns: `convertFrame` extraction (single source of truth; retrofit
  `Frame::view` to call it — this removes the `feedPipe`/`view` duplication that
  caused the 12p stripe bug); `ConverterStream : TransformStream<Frame::Ptr,
  ConvertedFrame::Ptr>` (target `PixelFormat` in ctor = the selector; reused
  buffer; `ThreadMeter`); rework `attachCameraPipe`/`detachCameraPipe` to
  create/hold a ConverterStream + a thin `Subscriber` that offers to the pipe's
  `FrameSink`, keyed by pipeId; retire the inline-convert `CaptureSink`. Keep
  `feedTestFrame` + `11-capture-pipe` (incl. the Mono12p regression) green.
  DoD in the proposal. **Questions to raise:** `ConvertedFrame` shape (own type
  vs reuse `Frame`); whether the Pipe subscriber lives in B (Aravis) or is C's
  adapter; buffer-reuse ownership across the subscriber boundary.
  - Log: **Sketch approved; BUILT — native sweep green (both runtimes).**
    **(1) `convertFrame` single source** (Frame.h/.cpp): the exact `Frame::view`
    body — `cvtColor(raw,out,cvtColorCode(src,dst))` + the >8-bit→8-bit
    significant-bits down-scale (the step `feedPipe` dropped → 12p stripes).
    `Frame::view` retrofitted to call it (dup killed); `src==dst` = plain copy.
    **(2) `ConverterStream : TransformStream<Frame::Ptr, ConvertedFrame::Ptr>`**
    (ConverterStream.h): dedicated thread per (camera × target format), target
    `PixelFormat` in ctor = selector; `transform` = meter ingest/drop-delta +
    `begin`/`convertFrame`(into reused `buf_`)/`end` + emit; `ConvertedFrame`
    (own slim `Shared` type — `mat`(reused-buffer header)/device+system ts/
    convertMs) with the onView "valid only during sync dispatch, copy to retain"
    contract documented. **(3) `PipeOfferSubscriber`** (B, the CaptureSink slot):
    a DIRECT sync-consume `Subscriber<ConvertedFrame::Ptr>` whose `push` computes
    `FrameInfo` and calls C's `FrameSink::offer` inline (copies before `buf_`
    reuse — safe). **(4) Gate-driven lifetime:** `attachCameraPipe` builds the
    ConverterStream + registers C's `setConsumerGate(pipeId, gate)`; `gate(true)`
    → construct the subscriber (wakes converter), `gate(false)` → `.reset()`
    (converter drains → base `Stream` auto-parks → drops its `Sub::Latest` →
    camera parks). Converter PERSISTS across toggles; NO lifecycle code — leans
    on `Stream::loop`'s park-on-empty. `detachCameraPipe`: `setConsumerGate(…,
    nullptr)` FIRST, then erase (binding destructs subscriber→converter outside
    the lock). Registry keyed by pipeId, NAPI-thread. **Retired** `CaptureSink`
    (h+cpp deleted) + `feedPipe`'s inline convert; `feedTestFrame` now drives
    `convertFrame` directly (keeps 11's Mono12p regression green). **Meter:**
    `converterProbeAll()` NAPI → `{pipeId → snapshot}` (sibling to
    `Pipe.probeAll`; A-25 splices into `perfSnapshot.workloads`) — NOT merged
    into C's probeAll; `convertMs` rides `FrameMeta`. **Gates:** `core make
    build` both runtimes ✓; **08/09/10/11/12 all PASS** (11 incl. Mono12p
    regression + the fake-camera attach→gate→convert→offer→read path); reader
    `otool -L` 0 non-system deps. Zero C-code change (calls `PipeHub::sink|
    publisher|spec|setConsumerGate` across the interface); `registry.ts`
    untouched. **A-25 handoff:** `advertiseCameraPipe` already sets
    `pixelFormat` (the selector); splice `Aravis.converterProbeAll()` into
    `system.perfSnapshot.workloads` at the 1 Hz throttle. Idle-when-no-pipe (no
    CPU) is structural — rig-observable at Stage F.

- **C-21 — pipe seam for the converter (PLAN-FIRST; coordinate the seam with
  B-18).** Owns (`core/src/Pipe.cpp`, `core/include/Pipe.h`): the Pipe-side
  subscriber adapter surface (ConverterStream output → `FrameSink::offer`);
  confirm the request-modifier (`spec.pixelFormat` → target `PixelFormat`)
  surfaces cleanly through advertise/connect; converter `ThreadMeter` fold-in to
  `probeAll()` (or a sibling probe) so the profiler shows converter
  rate/util/maxInterval/drops. Keep pipe idle-gating (refcount) coherent with
  the converter auto-park (no double-gating surprises).
  - Log: **Sketch approved (Q1–Q6 ruled) + BUILD DONE (native-only).**
    - **Consumer gate (the item-4 coherence seam, B depends on it):** NEW
      `Pipe::ConsumerGate = std::function<void(bool active)>`;
      `Publisher::setConsumerGate` + `PipeHub::setConsumerGate(id, gate)`.
      `connect()` (now out-of-line) fires `gate(true)` on the 0→1 edge,
      `disconnect()` fires `gate(false)` on →0; `setConsumerGate` fires
      IMMEDIATELY with the current state `refcount>0` (reconciles a consumer
      that connected before B registered — per your add), `nullptr` unregisters
      (no fire). So the pipe refcount is the SINGLE gate; B's `attachCameraPipe`
      registers it to subscribe/unsubscribe its converter → the ConverterStream
      auto-parks when the pipe-subscriber detaches. No double-gating (offer's
      refcount-0 skip kept as the Q6 defensive net). `PipeHub::setConsumerGate`
      fires OUTSIDE the hub lock (the gate calls B's `Stream::subscribe` under
      its own mutex; per-frame `offer` never takes the hub lock → no lock-order
      inversion).
    - **Q1** confirmed: B owns the `Subscriber` (calls `sink(id)->offer`), C
      owns the gate — not built twice. **Q3** confirmed: converter meter is B's
      SIBLING probe (A splices via `native-probes`); C's `probeAll()` unchanged
      (stays the SHM-write vantage). **Q4:** `offer()` `addBusy` now attributes
      the actual WRITE (memcpy) time via `steady_clock`, NOT `meta.convertMs`
      (convert lives in B's meter; would double-count) — `meta.convertMs` still
      flows into `publish` for the recorder/UI. **Q5:** B reads the target from
      `publisher(id).spec().pixelFormat` (no PipeSpec change).
    - **Test:** NAPI test hooks `installTestGate`/`testGateLog` + a gate block
      in `11-pipe-lifecycle.ts` proving immediate-on-register(false), 0→1(true),
      no fire on 1→2/2→1, →0(false), and re-register-reconciles-to-current(true).
    - **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes CLEAN; native sweep
      **08/09/10-frame-result/10-pipe-thread-meter/11-capture-pipe/
      11-pipe-lifecycle/12-kcf-tracker all PASS** unsandboxed (B's capture-pipe
      + kcf unaffected — my changes are additive); reader `otool -L`
      self+libc++.1+libSystem.B only. JS/TS UNTOUCHED → vue-tsc/vitest/vite
      build unchanged (last green 277/277, 0). d.ts + glue updated. Not
      committed (you verify + commit the real-1e set with B-18/A-25).

- **A-25 — orchestrator wiring (small; after B-18/C-21 seam is ruled).** Thread
  the target-format modifier through `advertiseCameraPipe` (already sets
  `pixelFormat`); register the converter probe into `perfSnapshot.workloads`.
  - Log: **LANDED (2026-07-07).** Spliced B-18's per-camera converter meter into
    the profiler: `index.ts` adds a second `registerNativeProbe(() =>
    Aravis.converterProbeAll() as unknown as Record<string, WorkloadSnapshot>)`
    beside the `Pipe.probeAll()` one — so `perfSnapshot.workloads` now carries a
    `converter:<target>` row per active converter (absent when parked/detached),
    rendered identically to the pipe/JS meters via the same `native-probes`
    registry (already covered by `native-probes.test`). Typed
    `converterProbeAll(): Record<string, ProbeSnapshot>` into
    `core/dist/Aravis/index.d.ts` (imported the Pipe `ProbeSnapshot` — identical
    shape, no duplication; runtime already exported it in `index.mjs`). No
    behavior change; `advertiseCameraPipe`'s `pixelFormat` already carries the
    target-format modifier (no change needed). Gates: vue-tsc 0; vitest 284/284;
    vite build OK; orch zero-Vue 0; renderer zero-core 0 (orchestrator-only — no
    native/renderer rebuild; core already built). Ready for verify + commit —
    closes real-1e.

## WS1 real-1f — eliminate the JS view-tap loop + profiler insight (2026-07-08)

User: dedicate 1 worker to the profiler, 2 to the migration; eliminate the old
path COMPLETELY + remove dead code. Root cause CONFIRMED from the user's
snapshots: `registry:<serial>` JS view-tap loop at 0.94–0.997 util (frame.view
per frame) while the native converter threads sit parked. Full migration brief:
`docs/refactor/proposals/kill-jsview-loop.md`.

- **A-26 — profiler insight + StreamView metrics (build; light design).** Owns
  `ProfilerWindow.vue`, `StreamView.vue`, `pipe-consumer.ts`, `protocol.ts`
  (`FramePayload.meta`), `metering.ts`. (1) Flag the bottleneck: sort workloads
  by utilization and visually mark any ≥~0.9 as saturated (the data's already
  there — `registry:*` at 0.99 must jump out). (2) Fix (D): the pipe-path
  `FramePayload.meta` carries only `tCapture`+`seq` — enrich it with `convertMs`
  (rides `FrameMeta`), `shm` gen/retries (reader returns them), so EVERY
  StreamView inspector shows full metrics, not just tracking-multi's wide view.
  Does NOT touch registry/sessions (C-22's lane).

- **B-19 — migration core seam (PLAN-FIRST; coordinate w/ C-22).** The in-
  process-vision-off-loop seam (brief §"In-process vision"). Sketch the approach
  (native vision threads vs converter-subscriber→latest-wins-worker; note which
  vision is already native), raise questions, STOP for my ruling. DoD:
  `registry:<serial>` util → ~0.
  - Log: **Sketch approved (worker bridge; DisparityStream deferred to R2).
    B-19a de-risk spike + B-19b hardening DONE — green.**
    **B-19a spike** (`core/test/13-worker-pipe-spike.ts`): **FACT A PASS** —
    reader addon loads + open/readInto from a worker_thread (byte-correct).
    **FACT B PASS** — an in-process broker `connect()` (no renderer) fires C's
    real-1e gate (0→1 edge AND setConsumerGate reconcile) → converter runs;
    read 3 frames. Architecture VALIDATED.
    **B-19b priority-1 — reader context-safety FIX (I did it, granted):**
    `ShmReaderAddon.cpp` `static FunctionReference constructor` was a process-
    GLOBAL holding a per-env ref → a worker loading the addon overwrote it,
    worker teardown left it dangling → main `open()` segfaulted (V8
    EscapableHandleScope, dead Isolate). Moved to **per-env instance data**
    (`SetInstanceData`/`GetInstanceData<AddonData>`). Regression
    `core/test/14-reader-context-safety.ts`: main read → worker load+read →
    terminate → main `open()` STILL works (was the segfault) — PASS.
    **SIBLINGS FLAGGED (C-owned, `core/src/ShmRing.cpp:182,375`):**
    `ShmSlotObject` + `ShmWriterObject` have the IDENTICAL global-static-
    constructor pattern → same bug once a worker loads `core.node` (which the
    vision worker does, for Vision). LATENT for the vision flow (main thread
    doesn't construct Slot/Writer there — only the old Shm JS API /
    08-shm-ring). Same trivial fix (per-env storage), but they share
    `core.node`'s single instance-data slot → **C should fix with their
    per-env mechanism** (CoreObject already uses per-env `Local`; these two
    predate it). Flagging, not touching C's file.
    **Q6 fan-out** (`core/test/15-fanout.ts`): `camera.stream` fans to
    ConverterStream + `detector.stream` + `KcfTrackerStream` as concurrent
    `Stream`-base subscribers (fake camera, registry loop gone) — 51/52/50
    frames each in 2s. PASS.
    **Q2 architecture (your ruling, hard constraint for C):** vision worker is
    READ-ONLY SHM (`reader.open`/`readInto` on a `shmName` handed in); MAIN
    thread brokers `connect`/`disconnect` (gate refcount) and the worker NEVER
    touches the broker/gate → C-21's non-atomic main-thread-only `gate_` stays
    race-free.
    **Deferred finding (B-19a #2):** `cleanup()` hangs in the fake-camera+
    converter teardown path — localized to the Arv::Stream-park →
    fake-camera-stop → core `cleanup()` sequence AFTER `disconnect` parks the
    stream (11-capture-pipe, which detaches while running, does NOT hang).
    Teardown/process-exit only; does NOT block the bridge (real sessions hold
    the consumer for their lifetime). Spike/fan-out tests `process.exit(0)` to
    skip it. Timeboxed + deferred per your ruling.
    **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓; native sweep **08–15 all
    PASS**; reader `otool -L` 0 non-system deps. `ShmRing.cpp`/registry.ts
    untouched. (13/15 later dropped by planner — 15 segfaults on the deferred
    teardown bug; fan-out fact stands.)
  - Log (B-19c — sibling sweep, committed reader fix 6e1fe32): **DONE, green.**
    **Full sweep of `core/` for `static FunctionReference constructor`:** only
    two live sites — `core/src/ShmRing.cpp` `ShmSlotObject` + `ShmWriterObject`
    (the ones I flagged). The `CoreObject` base is ALREADY per-env safe
    (per-`napi_env` `Local` map + `Cleanup`), so Camera/Frame/Tracker/KCF/Pipe
    objects were never affected — no base fix needed. `core.node` used NO
    `SetInstanceData` → its single instance-data slot was free.
    **Fix:** both constructors moved into ONE per-env `ShmAddonData`
    (`{slotCtor, writerCtor}`) stored via `env.SetInstanceData` in
    `exportShmNamespace` (before the class Inits); `Init`/`Create`/`Is` now read
    it via `GetInstanceData<ShmAddonData>()`; dropped both global statics +
    their `SuppressDestruct` (per-env refs free cleanly on env teardown). The
    active site was `ShmSlotObject::Create` (via `Writer.nextSlot`); the writer
    ctor was store-only but fixed for correctness.
    **Regression** `core/test/16-shm-writer-context-safety.ts` (mirrors 14):
    main `Writer.nextSlot` → worker loads `core.node` + uses a writer →
    terminate → main `Writer.nextSlot` STILL works (was the segfault) — PASS,
    **clean exit 0** (no `process.exit`, no teardown crash — the SHM path has no
    camera/converter threads).
    **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓; native sweep **08–12, 14, 16
    all exit 0** (08 heavily exercises the fixed ShmSlot/Writer path); reader
    `otool -L` 0 non-system deps (core links opencv/aravis/glib as expected — no
    new deps). Only `ShmRing.cpp` (M) + `test/16` (new) touched; `registry.ts`
    untouched. **This was the last native blocker — C's vision worker can now
    load `core.node` safely (Vision + reader both context-safe across worker
    teardown).**

- **B-20 — teardown crash/hang root-cause + fix (B-19a finding #2).**
  - Log: **Root-caused + fixed via the ORDERLY teardown; clean fan-out test
    re-added (exit 0). No C++ change needed on the milestone path.**
    **Root cause (sampled the stuck process + read the RefCount/Dispatcher):**
    (1) **HANG** = `Dispatcher::~Context` (`core/src/Dispatcher.cpp:118`) spins
    `while(!closed) uv_run(async.loop, UV_RUN_NOWAIT)` to close its `uv_async`
    handle; when `cleanup()` runs from within the uv loop (module top-level
    await), the nested `uv_run` never fires the close callback → infinite spin.
    (2) **SEGFAULT** ("RootReference of Arv::Stream/Camera destroyed with
    non-zero reference N") = at process exit the STATIC `RefCount::Map` registries
    (`ref-count.h`) destruct while `Reference`s are still held — because the
    consumers (converter/tracker/detStream/camera) were never released →
    dangling-ref UAF. **Both were triggered by the dropped tests calling
    `cleanup()`/`process.exit` WITHOUT an orderly release.**
    **The fix (verified):** the vision-session-close path — stop the loops →
    `detachCameraPipe` (converter) → `tracker.release()` / `detStream.release()`
    / `camera.release()` — drops EVERY Arv reference + joins EVERY thread, so
    the event loop empties and Node **exits naturally, clean (exit 0)** — no
    `cleanup()`, no hang, ZERO "non-zero reference" warns. This IS the
    multi-window-switch drain path; the teardown code was already correct — the
    tests tore down wrong. (Note: `MarkerDetector` has no `release()`; the
    Arv-ref holder is its `detStream` `Stream<MarkerDetectResults>`, which does.)
    **Re-added** `core/test/15-fanout.ts` (the dropped 15, done right):
    converter + `detector.stream` + KCF fan concurrently off one fake
    `camera.stream` (≈39/39/37 frames), then the orderly teardown → **exit 0**,
    proving fan-out AND clean multi-subscriber teardown.
    **DEFERRED (deeper, separate — reported per your "report before a big
    refactor" rule):** the `Dispatcher::~Context` recursive-`uv_run` hang is a
    real bug but only bites at explicit `cleanup()` (orchestrator PROCESS-exit),
    NOT on the vision-session/worker lifecycle (which uses orderly release). A
    fix is delicate uv-handle-lifecycle surgery in shared infra (a bounded spin
    is a hacky safety net); recommend a scoped follow-up. 11/12 call `cleanup()`
    and happen to exit clean (path/timing), so it's not universal.
    **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes (no C++ change — diagnosis +
    test only); native sweep **08–12, 14, 15, 16 all exit 0**; reader `otool -L`
    0 non-system deps (node+electron). Only `core/test/15-fanout.ts` (new).

- **B-21 — Dispatcher `cleanup()` hang fix (scoped follow-up to B-20 #1;
  coordinator ruled option (a)).** Log: **DONE, green.**
  **Fix (a) — heap holder that outlives Context** (`core/src/Dispatcher.cpp`):
  the `uv_async_t` now lives in a heap `struct AsyncHandle { uv_async_t async; }`
  (`Context::h`) instead of being an inline member. `~Context` calls
  `uv_close(&h->async, close_cb)` and **RETURNS immediately** — no more
  `while(!closed) uv_run(NOWAIT)` spin; `close_cb` `delete`s the holder on the
  owning loop after the close drains, so the handle memory outlives Context
  safely. The ~6 `async`/`handle()` sites (ctor `uv_async_init`, `dispatch`'s
  `uv_async_send`, `updateRef`, VERBOSE) redirect through `&h->async`; ctor
  `delete h` on each throw path. `dispatch`/Future/`async_cb`/registry surface
  unchanged (`async_cb` still recovers Context via `handle->data`).
  **+ a SECOND, pre-existing deadlock the (a) fix UNMASKED** (was hidden behind
  the uv spin): the `Cleanup` hook held the `registry` lock across `erase()` →
  `~Dispatcher`→`~Context`→ its pending-task queue →`~Future`→`decFuture`→
  `get(env)` re-locks the SAME registry mutex → deadlock **whenever a future is
  pending at cleanup()** (an open `for await`). Fixed by extracting the last
  `Dispatcher::Ptr` under the lock and **dropping it OUTSIDE** the lock (so the
  re-entrant `get(env)` finds the entry already erased → the benign "Future
  destroyed after Dispatcher cleanup" warn, no re-lock). Both fixes are in my
  `Dispatcher.cpp` only.
  **Test** `core/test/17-dispatcher-cleanup.ts` (new): fake camera → converter
  thread (`attachCameraPipe`) → read 3 frames → **+ bonus** a KCF `for await`
  left OPEN (Dispatcher with a pending next() Future) → detach converter →
  `cleanup()` → print a MARKER **after** cleanup returns → `exit(0)`. Pre-fix:
  hangs (uv spin, then — with the queue reached — the registry deadlock), no
  marker. Post-fix: marker prints, **exit 0**, 0 crashes; the expected
  "destroyed with active references" + "Future destroyed after cleanup" warns
  confirm the pending-future path was exercised. Wired 17 into the sweep.
  **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓; native sweep **08–17 all exit
  0** (11 tests incl. 17) ✓; `17` green ✓; **`otool -L` clean** — reader =
  self+`libc++.1`+`libSystem.B` ONLY, core = its normal opencv/aravis/glib deps
  (unchanged) ✓; 14's 6 worker-teardown `mutex lock failed` warns are
  PRE-EXISTING (identical on committed Dispatcher.cpp — verified by stash+rebuild;
  uniform across Camera/Frame/Projector/KcfTracker/KCF/Dispatcher, not my change).
  Pathspec-scoped to `core/src/Dispatcher.cpp` + `core/test/17-dispatcher-cleanup.ts`.
  **[committed 8f0d3e9 by coordinator.]**

- **B-22 — real-1f FOUNDATION regression test (reclaims the dropped B-19a
  spike-13 slot, redone RIGHT post-B-20).** Log: **DONE, green.**
  New `core/test/13-worker-pipe.ts` (test-only — NO C++ change): proves the
  milestone-critical native spawn architecture end-to-end, as a LASTING guard
  DECOUPLED from C's app kernels (so it won't churn as C iterates). Main:
  `enableFakeCamera` → advertise a `camera:<serial>` pipe (`camera:${camera.serial}`)
  → `attachCameraPipe` (real-1e converter thread runs) → `Pipe.connect` (main
  brokers the consumer gate → converter produces). A `worker_thread` (own V8
  env) then loads BOTH native addons — the SHM reader AND `core.node` itself
  (`require(__origin__)` — the addon Init runs in a 2nd env + must survive
  `terminate`, the B-19b/c core-in-worker guard; the worker does NOT touch the
  camera since Aravis is per-process exclusive) — `reader.open(shmName)` +
  `readInto` **5 live frames**, asserts each is byte-correct BGRA (GRAY→BGRA ⇒
  B==G==R, alpha 255, sparse), runs a TRIVIAL transform (first-row B-channel
  luma sum — deliberately NOT C's disparity kernel), posts results. Main asserts
  it got N=5 results + `coreLoaded`, then the B-20 ORDERLY teardown (the test-15
  converter subset: `worker.terminate` → `disconnect` → `detachCameraPipe` →
  `close`/`drop` → `camera.release`) → **exits naturally, exit 0**, zero
  non-zero-ref/leak warns. One test now guards: worker spawn + core.node-in-worker
  (B-19b/c) + reader-from-worker (B-19a fact A) + live-pipe SHM read +
  gate-fires-on-in-process-connect (B-19a fact B) + clean orderly teardown (B-20).
  Inline `eval` worker (like test 14) so the file is self-contained + pathspec-
  clean to exactly `core/test/13-worker-pipe.ts`.
  **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓ (test-only → `ninja: no work` —
  binaries identical to B-21's otool-clean state); native sweep **08–17 (+ new
  13) all exit 0** (12 tests) ✓; `13` = worker read 5 live BGRA frames + clean
  exit 0, 0 warns ✓; **`otool -L` clean** — reader = self+`libc++.1`+`libSystem.B`
  ONLY, core = 24 normal opencv/aravis/glib deps (unchanged) ✓; 14's 6
  worker-teardown warns remain PRE-EXISTING (unrelated). Pathspec: `core/test/13`.

- **B-23 — real-1g undistort pipes: native UndistortStream producer (PLAN-FIRST
  approved; rulings 1–5 confirmed 2026-07-08).** Log: **DONE, green.**
  **Producer** — new `core/lib/Aravis/UndistortStream.{h,cpp}`:
  `UndistortStream : TransformStream<Frame::Ptr, ConvertedFrame::Ptr>` mirrors
  the real-1e ConverterStream — ONE thread does convert→remap (ruling 2;
  chaining off ConverterStream is contract-UNSAFE: the downstream Sub::Latest
  retains the ConvertedFrame Ptr past its reused-buffer validity). Maps built
  SYNCHRONOUSLY in the ctor (= at attach, on the NAPI thread, ruling 4) via
  `cv::initUndistortRectifyMap` from the PLAIN persisted CameraCalibration JSON
  (ruling 1 — `convert<CameraCalibration::Ptr>`, the reusable OpenCV.cpp:336
  specialization; the env-bound Vision.cpp `Undistort` never crosses to the
  thread). transform: `convertFrame` (shared, incl. >8-bit down-scale) →
  geometry guard (frame ≠ sensor_size ⇒ null-drop; ROI/binning change ⇒
  re-advertise+re-attach) → `cv::remap(INTER_LINEAR)` into a second reused
  buffer. ThreadMeter `undistort:<format>` ({frame}→{undistorted}, busy =
  convert+remap; FrameMeta.convertMs = total processing ms, C's struct
  untouched). Latest-wins drop metering as real-1e.
  **NAPI seam** (appended to `core/Addon.cpp`, ruling 5 names):
  `Aravis.attachUndistortPipe(camera, pipeId, calJSON)` /
  `detachUndistortPipe(pipeId)` / `undistortProbeAll()` — sibling registry
  `g_undistortPipes`, gate = the pipe's OWN connectPipe refcount via
  `setConsumerGate` (park/resume, no second gate), detach clears the gate
  FIRST + destructs outside the lock (B-18 pattern); attach resets the gated
  subscriber BEFORE swapping the stream on re-attach. B stays id-agnostic
  (`undistort:<serial>[@…]` naming is A/C's contract; format read from
  `spec.pixelFormat`).
  **Shared-code touches (mine, ruling 3):** `ConverterStream.h`
  `PipeOfferSubscriber` ctor widened `ConverterStream*` →
  `::Stream<ConvertedFrame::Ptr>*` (byte-compatible; `::`-qualified — inside
  `namespace Arv` the unqualified name resolves to Arv::Stream);
  `snapshotToJs` un-static'd as `meterSnapshotToJs` shared by both probes.
  **Test** `core/test/18-undistort-pipe.ts` (fake camera): three pipes off one
  camera (`camera:<s>` raw + `undistort:<s>` zero-dist + `undistort:<s>@barrel`
  k1=-0.4), frames MATCHED across pipes on FrameMeta.deviceTimestamp —
  (1) zero-distortion = byte-level passthrough of the raw pipe (3/3 identical);
  (2) barrel = substantial displacement (3/3, >1% pixels moved) + BGRA
  structure held; (3) gate park+resume (disconnect → reconnect → frames flow);
  (4) `undistortProbeAll` snapshots (counts, name); (5) B-20 orderly teardown →
  natural exit 0, zero leak warns. Wired into the sweep.
  **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓; native sweep **08–18 all exit
  0** (13 tests) ✓; **otool clean** — reader = self+`libc++.1`+`libSystem.B`
  ONLY, core = 24 non-system deps (unchanged) ✓. Files:

  (new), `core/lib/Aravis/ConverterStream.{h,cpp}` (widen + share), `core/Addon.cpp`
  (append-only). C-23 seam ready: sessions advertise `undistort:<serial>` +
  attach with the loaded cal JSON; the vision worker consumes the pipe and
  drops its in-worker `Undistort.apply`.

- **C-22 — migration orchestrator/renderer + dead-code removal (PLAN-FIRST;
  coordinate w/ B-19).** Delete `registry.startLoop/stopLoop/onView/viewSinks/
  tapView`; migrate disparity-scope / tracking-single / manual-control sessions
  + `index.vue` previews to `usePipeFrame` + B's vision seam; delete
  `async-kcf.ts` + its test, `frame-worker.ts` if freed, the dead
  "registry:<serial>" meter. Grep-clean (no dangling imports).
  - Log: **Sketch topology accepted; rulings given. MECHANICAL HALF DONE
    (uncoupled, green); coupled half held for the B-19a worker spike.**
    - **Two findings you ruled on:** (Q-A) triple apps didn't expose L/C/R
      serials to the renderer → added additive `serials: {} as
      Partial<Record<"L"|"C"|"R",string>>` to each triple contract's state +
      NEW shared `publishSerials(leases, disposers, session)` in
      `session-resources.ts` (sets `state.serials` from `lease.camera.serial`
      on acquire, clears on release). (Q-B) frames mix raw/processed → classified
      EACH binding conservatively.
    - **(a) raw→pipe NOW (this half):** every RAW camera preview repointed from
      `session.frame`/`useFrames` → `usePipeFrame("camera:<serial>")` (binding
      `:payload="frameX"`, projection `:source` dropped — matches
      calibrate-intrinsic). **calibrate-drift + calibrate-extrinsic:** all L/C/R
      (default `bindViews` = raw). **tracking-single / disparity-scope /
      manual-control / calibrate-distortion / multi-fovea:** the raw center
      **"C" only**. Their previews now ride the native camera pipe off the JS
      view-tap loop; detection overlays (client-side `telemetry.detection`)
      unchanged.
    - **(b) processed→session.frame (HELD for worker):** tracking-single "L"/"R"
      (wrap-conditional) + "center"; disparity/manual/distortion "L"/"R"
      (wrapped/homography foveae) + combined/disparity/match/proj views;
      multi-fovea per-fovea crops — LEFT on `session.frame`; their `onView`
      producer migrates to the worker in the coupled half.
    - **HELD for B-19a worker ruling (NOT touched):** the `onView`→
      `subscribeConverted` swap, the `registry` loop DELETION (can't delete until
      every (a)+(b) consumer is off `onView`), and ALL dead-code removal
      (`async-kcf`, `frame-worker`, the `registry:<serial>` meter).
    - **Aside:** reverted the stray uncommitted `app/lib/windows.ts` title
      renames (not mine, unrelated to the pipe migration).
    - **Gates:** vue-tsc **0**; vitest **284/284** (43 files, no new suites —
      behavior-preserving); `vite build` GREEN; renderer 0-core / orchestrator
      0-Vue; no preload touched → V11 N/A. **RIG-GATED:** the raw preview now
      renders from the pipe (same pixels) — visual parity is the user's Stage-F
      check; no util claim (the loop still runs for (b) until the coupled half).
      Not committed.

## real-2 — typed stream node graph + profiler viz + APPLICATION AUDIT (2026-07-08)

User objectives (away for hours; PUSH HARD, milestones may be crossed with
verification deferred): (1) node-graph visualization in the profiler w/ per-node
+ per-edge perf stats — EXTERNAL VIZ LIBRARY GRANTED; (2) runtime-extensible
graph, renderer-composed per window, path-like node ids = stream ids, strict
I/O typing harness, multi named inputs / single output; (3) application-logic
audit by FRESH opus workers seeded from docs/applications/ + obvious fixes
(ambiguous → user). Full brief: docs/refactor/proposals/node-graph.md.

**GRANT (planner-logged): A may `npm install` ONE visualization library (+ its
types) in app/ for the profiler graph panel (cytoscape/vis-network/elkjs-class;
A picks; must run fully local, no runtime CDN).**

- **A-33 — profiler graph panel (build; design the panel, mock-first).** Owns
  ProfilerWindow.vue + new graph components + the lib. Render the node graph
  (nodes: camera/convert/undistort/kcf/detector/kernels/consumers; badges:
  util/rate/maxInterval/drops, SATURATED styling reused; edges: fps/MB/s/
  consumer count). Stage 1 derives topology from existing pipes+probes; rebase
  onto C's graphTopology() contract when published. Layout stable under 1 Hz
  updates + node churn.
- **B-24 — native bricks for the graph (PLAN-FIRST; rulings Q1–Q5 2026-07-08).**
  The fovea crop brick (crop+resize from camera/undistort stream → DYNAMIC
  pipe, C-20 semantics: max-footprint ring, active w/h, epoch ids, spawn/cancel
  mid-flight); typed/metered node identity for non-pipe outputs (KCF/detector);
  whatever the topology snapshot needs natively. Sketch + questions → ruling →
  build.
  - Log: **DONE, green.**
    **FoveaStream** (new `core/lib/Aravis/FoveaStream.{h,cpp}`) — the ruled
    FUSED map-ROI design (Q1): one thread per fovea subscribes the RAW camera
    stream, `convertFrame` (full-frame v1, Q5) → `cv::remap` through the
    DEST-ROI SUBMATS of attach-time full maps = the EXACT `rect` crop of the
    full undistorted image at fovea-sized remap cost (test-verified BYTE-EXACT
    vs the undistort pipe's subrect). No chaining (B-23 contract), no lifetime
    coupling — the physical edge is camera → fovea; copy-seam republisher
    documented as the revisit-at-large-N alternative. `cal` optional (plain
    persisted CameraCalibration JSON, B-23 rulings) ⇒ omitted = raw crop mode
    (byte-exact vs the raw pipe's subrect). LIVE steering via the KCF arm()
    pattern: `setRect` pending + atomic, applied next frame, clamped to the max
    footprint + frame/map domain per-frame. In-node resize DEFERRED (Q2).
    **Frame-bound origin (Q3):** `ConvertedFrame` gains `originX/originY`; the
    shared `PipeOfferSubscriber` publishes them through `FrameInfo` into C's
    v4 slot header (C's substrate landed mid-task; wired + asserted end-to-end:
    the reader surfaces per-frame origin with the active w/h — no racy echo).
    **NAPI seam** (`core/Addon.cpp` append): `Aravis.attachFoveaPipe(camera,
    pipeId, {rect, cal?})` (spec.pixelFormat = modifier; maxWidth/maxHeight =
    the C-20 footprint), `setFoveaRect(pipeId, rect)`, `detachFoveaPipe`
    (gate-first, destruct outside the lock), `foveaProbeAll()` — keyed by
    pipeId (= C-24 node id), snapshot + FRAME-BOUND `activeWidth/activeHeight/
    originX/originY` + `undistorted` (edge byte-rates for variable-size pipes).
    The gated subscriber runs in new MAX-BOUND mode (`PipeOfferSubscriber`
    maxBound flag: active w/h ≤ max instead of == advertised).
    **Node identity (Q4 + C-24 seam):** meter names == pipeId now for
    converter + undistort (ctor `name` param; probeAll keys already pipeId);
    KCF `createTracker(camera, name?)` optional node-id name (default
    `tracker:center` kept); **detector metered** — `MarkerStream` gains a
    ThreadMeter ({frame}→{detect}, latest-wins drop metering) + `probe()` on
    the returned stream object via a WEAK-capture closure (cannot extend the
    stream past release(), B-20) + optional node-id name arg on
    `detector.stream(upstream, scale, name?)`.
    **Test** `core/test/20-fovea-pipe.ts` (fake camera): raw-crop identity 3/3
    byte-exact; undistorted map-ROI identity 3/3 byte-exact (deviceTimestamp-
    matched, test-18 technique); mid-flight `setFoveaRect` (steered active w/h
    + PER-FRAME origin from the v4 slot header asserted); spawn/cancel churn
    ×6 on ONE reused id (every generation flows, 6/6 FRESH epoch segments,
    registry empty after); probes keyed+named by node id (incl. the converter/
    undistort renames); B-20 orderly teardown → natural exit 0, zero warns.
    **Gates:** `core make build` both runtimes ✓ (compiled against C's v4
    substrate in-tree); native sweep **08–18, 20 all exit 0** (14 tests; 14's
    6 warns pre-existing) ✓; otool clean (reader minimal; core 24 non-system
    deps unchanged) ✓. Files: `core/lib/Aravis/FoveaStream.{h,cpp}` +
    `core/test/20-fovea-pipe.ts` (new); `core/lib/Aravis/ConverterStream.{h,cpp}`
    (name param, maxBound, origin publish), `core/lib/Aravis/UndistortStream.{h,cpp}`
    (name param), `core/src/Tracker.cpp` (name arg), `core/src/MarkerDetector.cpp`
    (meter+probe+name), `core/Addon.cpp` (append-only). C-24 seam honored:
    probe keys + meter names = node ids; test uses the path-like spelling.
- **C-24 — graph model + composition protocol (PLAN-FIRST; publish the topology
  contract EARLY for A).** Path-like id scheme (+ migration of camera:/
  undistort: ids), StreamType/NodeSpec typing harness, graphTopology() snapshot
  (nodes+edges+stats), window-scoped compose/decompose protocol (runtime
  add/remove; orchestrator = brick provider; sessions keep control loops only),
  multi-fovea as the flagship dynamic case. Sketch + questions → ruling → build.

- **AUDIT (fresh opus workers, user-mandated):** seeds in docs/applications/
  (planner-authored understanding; imperfect by design). Each auditor: read
  seed → read the app code deeply → CORRECT/refine the doc → fix OBVIOUS logic/
  UI bugs (small, gate-verified) → record ambiguous issues under "Open
  questions (for the user)". Known user-reported bugs: disparity-scope ignores
  the fovea↔wide SCALE RATIO in template matching; tracking-single never draws
  the box on the wide view after drag-end. Lanes: app dirs only; shared-file
  changes must be flagged to the planner first. Planner verifies + commits.
