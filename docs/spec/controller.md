# Controller & actuation nodes — behavior spec

Behavioral contracts for the MEMS controller thread node and its actuation model.
Source pointers are per section; the code carries only load-bearing invariants inline.

## Controller node {#controller-node}

Source: `app/orchestrator/controller-node.ts`
(`docs/proposals/controller-node-and-fifo-edges.md` §3)

One long-lived singleton — the graph node id `nodeId.controller()` ("controller") —
created at orchestrator startup. It binds/unbinds the active `Controller` (serial
device) as the controller session connects/disconnects, so PID-node edges registered
before the device connects stay stable.

Native-free by construction: it takes injected FIN-sink seams and type-only
`Controller`/`FrameOutcome` imports, so sessions and vitest never pull the addon (same
idiom as `UndistortPipeSeam` / the scheduler's requester).

### Push actuation model (absorbs `startActuationLoop`)

`openPosition(name, { from, initial })` opens a position-stream input. Sessions push a
pose at their own natural cadence (kernel result / pointer / servo tick / paced timer);
the node transports it to the device:

- v2 firmware — each input maps 1:1 to an MCU `CMD_STREAM` (created lazily on first
  update against a live controller, `StreamUpdateGate`-gated fire-and-forget updates,
  terminated on close, recreated on a controller swap). Free-run DAC-follow is
  firmware-defined (CREATE drives).
- v1 firmware — ONE node-level paced loop awaits `actuate()` over the most-recent
  pushed pose (single-input assumption holds via app exclusivity today).

`update()` runs `predictVolts` + `mirrorHistory.record` (the ONE place for the
trusted-time trajectory) and returns the predicted volts synchronously — sessions use
the return for telemetry / homography feeders. Optional `onApplied(volts, actuateMs)`
delivers the v1 awaited readback. When no controller is bound the last predicted value
is returned (the mirror holds) and nothing is recorded.

### Enable lifecycle

Enable on first update against a live disabled controller (tracked `enabledByUs`);
disable on last close IFF we enabled it — never disable a controller the user enabled
via the title bar. A reconnect drops the streams and lazily recreates them; it NEVER
calls disable on a vanished/swapped controller. The hardware-quiescence invariant
(disable-on-disconnect in `sessions/controller.ts` + the janitor) is the sole owner of
that path, and this node must not bypass it.

### Native position input {#native-position-input}

Source: `docs/proposals/native-compose-controller.md`. A session pipes a native volts
producer (the compose brick's `volt_out`) into the sink's `pos_in` whenever one
attaches. Attach requires a bound v2 controller — the node creates the MCU stream
(ACK-backed) + native sink lazily on open or on a later `bindController`, and detaches
(sink released + stream TERMINATEd best-effort) on unbind/close. Enable/disable
lifecycle matches the JS inputs (enable on attach, disable iff we enabled when the last
input — JS or native — closes), so FW5 + hardware quiescence hold identically.

### Trigger capture

`startTriggerCapture` schedules round-robin `CMD_FRAME` (the pure, tested
`RoundRobinFrameScheduler`, `scheduler.ts`) and forwards each FIN outcome to the
registered FIN sinks (`onFin`) — the anchor enrichment node (`anchor-node.ts`). The
per-frame L/R pair matching that used to live here is superseded by the native root
PairStream (`docs/proposals/pairing-nodes.md` ruling 6): the brick tolerance-matches raw
camera arrivals against the FIN anchor on its own thread. `sync.ts`
`matchPair`/`matchesExposure` stay as the ruled pure-JS reference (unit tests keep them).

## PID node {#pid-node}

Source: `app/orchestrator/pid-node.ts`
(`docs/proposals/pid-nodes-and-view-replumb.md` §"PID node design")

A graph-visible PID controller node: control math a module ran inline (e.g.
disparity-scope's `stepVergence`) becomes a first-class node in the stream topology.
It consumes an upstream analysis result (e.g. the scope's projected fovea centers) and
produces a command for a downstream node (the MEMS `controller/<port>`). This is NOT
per-frame JS work — it runs scalar controllers at the upstream RESULT rate, so the
thin-coordinator rule holds: the node forwards a final result, it does not micro-manage
frames.

Two responsibilities beyond holding PIDs:

1. Topology — on creation it registers a `registerGraphWiring` entry (the C-24 stage-1
   shim) so the node + its scope→pid and pid→controller edges show in the profiler
   graph; `dispose()` retires it. `report()` returns the equivalent `NodeReport`.
2. Override — a renderer-driven slot (`usePidOverride` proxy → module command → here)
   that PINS the output. Ruled semantics: while engaged, `step()` SKIPS the control fn
   and RESETS every named controller each tick (state held at zero, so windup can't
   accumulate behind the override); the output IS the override value. On `release()`
   the caller-supplied `seed(lastOverride)` reseeds the controllers from the last
   override — with the velocity-form integrator that gives output CONTINUITY (no jump),
   reproducing "resume control from where the drag left the mirrors".

## Homography feeder {#homography-feeder}

Source: `app/orchestrator/homography-feeder.ts` (unified-time-and-topology §3+§5)

While a triple session is active, each L/R homography undistort brick needs a steady
stream of `{hostNs, H}` samples in its native ParamRing so the undistort thread can warp
every frame with `H(mirrorAt(frameHostNs))`. This helper runs a modest fixed-rate timer
(~200 Hz — well under the ring's ~1 kHz design ceiling, dense enough that the ring's
linear interpolation between neighbors tracks the ~1 kHz actuation trajectory) that:

1. reads the newest mirror sample from the orchestrator-wide `mirrorHistory` (written by
   the controller node's update path),
2. derives H for its side via the injected `computeH` seam,
3. pushes it via `Aravis.pushHomography(pipeId, hostNs, h9)` with hostNs = the SAMPLE's
   time (not push time) — the brick matches frames against when the mirror was there.

`computeH` returning null = no push (empty history, uncalibrated rig, or a
deliberately-unwired v1 seam) — the brick meters `passthrough`. Everything is injected
(history/clock/push) so vitest drives the cadence with fake timers and never loads core.

## Prediction-compose reference {#compose-reference}

Source: `app/orchestrator/compose-node.ts`
(`docs/proposals/native-compose-controller.md`)

The prediction-compose feed-forward math, kept as the JS CONFORMANCE REFERENCE. The
wave-1 `createComposeNode` graph node is retired: the compose is now the native
`ComposeStream` brick (core/src/ComposeStream.cpp) piped imm → compose → controller, and
its per-tick math must reproduce this function on the shared vectors
(docs/schema/codec/compose-vectors.json) — the same TS-reference pattern as
`@lib/imm-predictor` for the IMM brick.

The ruled form is `V(t) = V_pid + J·(p_pred(t) − p_meas(t_pid))`. This reference expresses
`J·Δp` as the difference of a pixel→volt map evaluated at both points
(`predVolts − measVolts`) — for the LINEAR map the native brick receives (the session's
finite-difference Jacobian at `p_meas`), the two forms are identical, which is exactly what
the fixture pins.

## Serial-latency compensation {#serial-latency}

Source: `app/orchestrator/serial-latency.ts` (serial-rate-governor Part 4)

The per-triple `delay_compensation_ms` is a FIXED lookahead; the serial hop's contribution
varies with queue depth / host load. With the wave-6 pressure sensors it becomes adaptive:
`serialLatencyMs = EMA(ackRttMs.p50) / 2` (one-way ≈ half the ACK round trip; EMA smoothing
so RTT jitter never whips the predictor). The disparity-scope session polls the estimate at
its stats throttle and pushes `imm.setParams({ delayMs: fixed + (enabled ? latency : 0) })`.
Gated by the GLOBAL `serial_latency_comp` config key (default OFF). Off / no controller / no
RTT samples yet = byte-identical fixed behavior. Vue-free (store-hub read/subscribe); the EMA
is a pure class, unit-tested.

## Anchor enrichment node {#anchor-node}

Source: `app/orchestrator/anchor-node.ts` (pairing-nodes ruling 4)

A JS, FIN-rate (low, loop-safe) middle node. Each completed controller exposure (FIN
`FrameOutcome`) becomes ONE stage-independent anchor — its exposure time + stream + the
enrichment attachments (exposure-averaged volts, the V2A angles, and the per-side homography
H) — pushed to EVERY registered pairing brick. One anchor source feeds all stages; the native
brick treats the attachments as an OPAQUE `Float64Array` payload and echoes it back in the
pair record, so the RECORDER (a downstream consumer) unpacks them JS-side. Native-free by
construction (same idiom as controller-node.ts): the pairing bricks are injected as a small
`PairAnchorSink` seam and the volts→angle→H math via the triple's `CoordinateConversions`, so
vitest drives it with a fake calibration and never loads the addon.

## Mirror history {#mirror-history}

Source: `app/orchestrator/mirror-history.ts` (unified-time-and-topology §4)

Short memory of mirror positions vs host time. The fovea/L-R undistort homography needs the
mirror position AT THE FRAME'S (past) exposure time — commands are issued up to ~1 kHz while
frames arrive at ~60 fps, so the orchestrator keeps a small ring of `{hostNs, left, right}`
and answers `mirrorAt(hostNs)` with linear interpolation between the two neighbors. Writers
(controller-node.ts — the ONE trajectory place): every SENT position update records its
`predictVolts` result; the v1 awaited `actuate()` path records the readback. Honesty note
(§4): these are COMMANDS — the physical mirror follows with LPF group delay (~1.3 ms at the
120 Hz LPF) + settle; triggered captures should prefer the FIN exposure-averaged voltage when
present (P4).

## Prediction-rate setting {#prediction-rate}

Source: `app/orchestrator/prediction-rate.ts` (prediction-compose-node ruling 2)

The GLOBAL prediction-rate setting, orchestrator side: ONE app-wide key `prediction_rate_hz`
(default 600, clamped 60..1000) that drives the native IMM brick's free-running emit rate.
Edited from BOTH Settings → Global config AND the disparity-scope drawer slider — they write
the SAME `["config"]` document, so the session subscribes here and live-applies via
`imm.setParams({ rateHz })`. Vue-free (store-hub read/subscribe, mirroring anaglyph-style) —
imported by a session, so it must not pull `@lib/config` (Vue). The doc path, default, and
clamp bounds are the shared Vue-free `@lib/config-schema` constants (same ones `@lib/config`'s
AppConfig defaults consume), so the renderer and this reader can never drift.

## Clock-metrics bridge {#clock-calibration}

Source: `app/orchestrator/clock-calibration.ts` (unified-time FINAL ruling 0)

JS side of the clock-metrics channel. The hardware owner THREADS own calibration — initial at
device init + incremental drift every 30s, entirely native (ClockCalibration.cpp). There is
NO JS calibration driver anymore (a second latch driver would race the owner thread on the
TimestampLatch device register), and no per-brick offset push (owner-applied dt makes every
surfaced timestamp trusted at the source). This module just BRIDGES the owner's pushed metrics
into the JS-side registry (`time-align.ts`) that feeds perfSnapshot.clocks / telemetry:
`Aravis.onClockMetrics` is the CallbackSlot channel — a lock-free armed flag native-side means
the owner threads skip the uv dispatch entirely until this registration happens.
